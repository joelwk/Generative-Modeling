       "      <td>China ( Pinyin: Zhōngguó) is a cultural region, an ancient civilization, and a nation in East Asia. The official name is People's Republic of China or PRC.\\n\\nThe last Chinese Civil War (19271949) resulted in two different political powers today:\\n\\n  The Republic of China (ROC) (since 1911), commonly known as China since 1 January, 1911 to 25 October, 1971. Now commonly known as Taiwan, has control over the islands of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu.\\n  The People's Republic of China (PRC) (since 1949), commonly known as China, has control over mainland China and the largely self-governing territories of Hong Kong (since 1997) and Macau (since 1999).\\n\\nChina is one of the world's oldest civilizations: it has the oldest continuous civilization near the Yellow River region. There is archaeological evidence over 5,000 years old. China also has one of the world's oldest writing systems (and the oldest in use today). China has been the source of many major inventions. Geographically, China’s longest river is the Yangtze River which runs through mega cities and is home to many species. It is the world’s third longest river.\\n\\n Origins \\nThe first recorded use of the word \"China\" is dated 1555.\"China\", Online Etymology Dictionary It is derived from chīnī, a Persian adjective meaning 'Chinese' which was popularized in Europe by Marco Polo.Wood, Francis, Did Marco Polo go to China (1995), p. 61.\\n\\n History \\n\\nthumb|left|The Great Wall of China\\n\\n Ancient (2100 B.C.  1500 A.D.) \\nAncient China was one of the first civilizations and was active since the 2nd millennium BC as a feudal society. Chinese civilization was also one of the few to invent writing, with the others being Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley civilization, the Maya civilization, the Minoan civilization of ancient Greece, and Ancient Egypt. It reached its golden age during the Tang Dynasty (c. A.D. 10th century). Home of Confucianism and Daoism, it had great influence on nearby countries including Japan, Korea, and Vietnam in the areas of political system, philosophy, religion, art, writing and literature. China is home to some of the oldest artwork in the world. Statues and pottery, as well as decorations made of jade, are some classic examples.\\n\\nBefore the Qin Dynasty united China, there were many small feudal states, nominally loyal to the Zhou King, that fought each other for hundreds of years in a war to control China. The majority of these states were ruled by relatives and clansmen of the Zhou royal house and carried the surname Ji (姬) and so were tied by family bonds to the Zhou king, to whom they were ritually subordinate, as members of collateral or lesser lineages. A minority of these states, such as the Qin and Chu, were ruled by non-Zhou clansmen, and were awarded their fiefs on account of some merit. Over time, these feudal states attained to power and wealth, that exceeded that of their Zhou nominal overlord, whose direct authority became confined to a very small territory near present-day Zhengzhou. These states also began to acquire some distinctive characteristics and identities of their own during the long centuries of loose control by the Zhou. Eventually, the Zhou kings were eclipsed in power by two especially problematic vassals - the Qin and Chu, and the functional independence of the Qin later led to its gradual conquest of all other vassal states and the formal supplantation of the Zhou to form a heavily centralised Empire.\\n\\nThe long decline of the Zhou, incidentally the longest ruling dynastic house of China, is known as the Warring States Period. Despite the bloodiness and strife of the period, this was the time when many great philosophies emerged - including Confucianism and Daoism as a response to disintegrating central authority of the Zhou kings and fluctuating power of the vassal states, and the general uncertainty of that era. Confucianism and Daoism have been the foundation of many social values seen in modern east Asian cultures today.\\n\\nOther notable dynasties include the Han (from which is derived the ethnonym the Han Chinese, which is synonymous with the older self-referential term - the Huaxia) as well as dynasties such as the Tang, Song, and Ming, which were characterised by periods of affluence, wealth, population growth, and the proliferation of literature.\\n\\nDuring the later years, China was often raided or invaded by northern nomadic people such as the Xiongnu, the Xianbei, the Jurchens and the Mongols (the latter led by Genghis Khan and Kublai Khan). One effect of regular nomadic invasion and the collapse of native dynasties was the massive migration of Han Chinese - especially the aristocratic elite and the literati, to sparsely populated frontier regions south of the Yangzi river such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong and Fujian. Several notable waves of Han Chinese immigration to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong and Fujian took place during the collapse of the Jin, the Tang, and the Song.\\n\\nSome nomadic groups succeeded in conquering the whole territory of China, establishing dynasties such as the Yuan (Mongol) and Qing (Manchu). Each time, they also brought new elements into Chinese culture - for instance, military uniform, the qipao and the pigtail, the latter of which was deeply resented by the Han Chinese.\\n\\n A new age \\n\\nWhile China achieved many things in the First millennium and early 2nd millennium, it became an isolationist country in the 15th century C.E. This was because Spain found enormous silver in the new continent, which was the main currency (money) in China and Europe at the time, and China did not want to be bought by the foreigners.\\n\\nBy the time of the Renaissance, European powers started to take over other countries in Asia. While China was never actually taken over, many European countries, such as Britain and France built spheres of influence in China. Since China had cut itself off from the world over the previous few centuries, by the Qing Dynasty, it had fallen behind other countries in technology, and was helpless to stop this from happening. This had become clear when it lost the Opium Wars to Britain in the 19th century.\\n\\nStill influenced by Western sources, China faced internal strife. The Taiping Rebellion or Taiping War occurred in China from 1851 through 1864. The Taiping Rebellion was led by Hong Xiuquan from Guangdong. Hong Xiuquan was influenced by Christian missionaries and declared himself the brother of Jesus. Hong made his mission to bring down the Qing Dynasty. Gaining influence on the southern Chinese population, the Taiping Rebellion attracted tens of thousands of supporters. The Taiping regime successfully created a state within the Qing Empire with the capital at Nanjing. Hong called his new state the Taiping Tianguo or \"The Heavenly State of Great Peace\". Local armies eventually suppressed the rebellion at the final battle of Nanjing.Mitter, Rana, Modern China: A Very Short Introduction p. 22.\\n\\nIn 1911, the Republic of China was founded after the Xinhai revolution led by Sun Yat-sen, but its government was very weak. Warlords controlled many areas. Chiang Kai-shek led wars against them, and he became president and dictator.\\n\\nIn 1931, Japan invaded Manchuria, a place in the northeastern part of China. On July 7, 1937, the Japanese attacked the rest of the country, starting what was called the Second Sino-Japanese War.\\n\\nOn December 13 of that same year, The Japanese Army killed an estimated (guessed) 200,000 to 300,000 Chinese civilians (people) which is called Nanjing Massacre. The war later became part of World War II. The war was fought for eight years and millions of Chinese people were killed.\\n\\nHowever, the Chinese Civil War later started between the Kuomintang (Nationalists) of the Republic of China (ROC) and the Communists of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The Communists wanted to make China like the Soviet Union, whereas the other side wanted to keep China in its current state at the time. The Communists were led by Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai and others. The Communists eventually won the war by uniting all the people from different positions. The Nationalists (led by Chiang Kai-shek) fled to the island of Taiwan and set up their new capital city in Taipei. After the Chinese Civil War, the Communist leader Mao Zedong declared a new country, the People's Republic of China (PRC), in Beijing on October 1, 1949.\\n\\nUnder Mao the country stayed poor while Taiwan became richer. His attempt at industrialization and collectivization with the Great Leap Forward led to the deaths of many people from famine. The Cultural Revolution caused great social upheaval. After 1976, China underwent market economy reforms under Deng Xiaoping, and experienced rapid economic growth, which made the former progress made by Taiwan became overshadowed. China is now one of the largest economies in the world, relying mainly on exports and manufactering.\\n\\nIn recent history, China has had problems with protests, blocking of information on the Internet, and censorship of news. 1989 was notable for the controversial Tiananmen Square protests. Since the 2008 Olympics, China has hosted many major international events, and the 2022 Winter Olympics were held in Beijing, China.\\n\\n Geography \\nthumb|Köppen-Geiger climate classification map for China\\nChina's landscape is vast and diverse. It ranges from the Gobi and Taklamakan Deserts in the north to subtropical forests in the south. The Himalaya, Karakoram, Pamir and Tian Shan mountain ranges separate China from much of South and Central Asia. The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers run from the Tibetan Plateau to the densely populated eastern coast. The Yangtze River is the third-longest river in the world while the Yellow River is the sixth-longest. China's coastline along the Pacific Ocean is 14,500 kilometers (9,000 mi) long. It is bounded by the Bohai, Yellow, East China and South China seas. China connects through the Kazakh border to the Eurasian Steppe. The Eurasian Steppe has been an artery of communication between East and West since the Neolithic through the Steppe route. The Steppe Route is the ancestor of the terrestrial Silk Road(s).\\n\\n Politics \\nthumb|The Great Hall of the People where the National People's Congress is held\\nthumb|The Zhongnanhai, a headquarter of the Chinese government and Communist Party of China\\nChina's constitution states that The People's Republic of China \"is a socialist state under the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants\". It also states the state organs \"apply the principle of democratic centralism.\" The PRC is one of the world's only socialist states openly being communist.\\n\\n Military \\nWith 2.3 million active troops, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is the largest standing military force in the world. The PLA is commanded by the Central Military Commission (CMC). China has the second-biggest military reserve force, only behind North Korea. The PLA consists of the Ground Force (PLAGF), the Navy (PLAN), the Air Force (PLAAF), and the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF). According to the Chinese government, China's military budget for 2017 was US$151,5 billion. China has the world's second-largest military budget.\\n\\n Science and technology \\nthumb|Earliest known written formula for gunpowder, from the Wujing Zongyao of 1044 CE\\nChina was once a world leader in science and technology up until the Ming dynasty. There are many Ancient Chinese discoveries and inventions. For example, papermaking, printing, the compass, and gunpowder are known as the Four Great Inventions. They became widespread across East Asia, the Middle East and later to Europe. Chinese mathematicians were the first to use negative numbers. By the 17th century, Europe and the Western world became better than China in science and technology.\\n\\n Demographics \\nThe national census of 2010 recorded the population of the People's Republic of China to be about 1,370,536,875. About 16.60% of the population were 14 years old or younger, 70.14% were between 15 and 59 years old, and 13.26% were over 60 years old. The population growth rate for 2013 is estimated to be 0.46%.\\n\\n Culture \\nChina is the origin of Eastern martial arts, called Kung Fu or its first name Wushu. China is also the home of the well-respected Spa Monastery and Wudang Mountains. Martial art started more for the purpose of survival, defense, and warfare than art. Over time some art forms have branched off, while others have retained their distinct Chinese flavor.\\n\\nChina has had renowned artists including Wong Fei Hung (Huang Fei Hung or Hwang Fei Hung) and many others. Art has also co-existed with a variety of paints including the more standard 18 colors. Legendary and controversial moves like Big Mak are also praised and talked about within the culture.\\n\\nChina has many traditional festivals, such as Spring Festival, Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-autumn Festival and so on. The most important is Chinese New Year. People in China will have holidays to celebrate these festivals.\\n\\n Festivals \\nSpring Festival is the Chinese New Year.\\n\\nDragon Boat Festival is celebrated to commemorate the death of Qu Yuan, a patriotic poet of the State of Chu during the Warring States period. He persuaded his emperor not to accept Qin's diplomats' offers several times but his emperor did not listen to him. He was very sad and ended up jumping into the river to end his life. The people loved him so much that they did not want the fish to eat his corpse. They made and threw rice dumplings into the river. They hope the fish eat these dumplings instead of the poet's corpse. They also rowed dragon boats in the river to get rid of the fish. Such practices, eating rice dumplings and holding dragon boat races, become what Chinese do in this festival nowadays.\\n\\nHeld on the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month, Mid-Autumn Festival is a festival for families. Now when the festival sets in, people would sit together to eat moon cakes, appreciate the bright full moon cakes, appreciate the bright full moon, celebrate the bumper harvest and enjoy the family love and happiness. To the Chinese people, the full moon symbolizes family reunion, as does the \"moon cakes.\" Hence the Mid-Autumn Festival is also called the Family Reunion Festival.\\n\\n Notes \\n\\n References \\n\\n Other websites \\n\\n Map of China\\n City Photo Gallery of China\\n China | Geography | People | Economy\\n China -Citizendium\\n\\nCategory:Divided regions\\n \\nCategory:Republics</td>\n",

       "      <td>Africa is the second largest continent in the world. It makes up about a fifth of the world's land. It is surrounded by large areas of water. There are 54 fully recognised and independent countries in Africa, and 14.7% (1.216 billion) of the world's population lives there. It is thought to be the continent where the first humans evolved.\\n\\n History \\nthumb|Civilizations before European colonization.\\nThe history of Africa begins with the first modern human beings and continues to its present difficult state as a politically developing continent.\\n\\nAfrica's ancient historic period includes the rise of Egyptian civilization.  It also includes the development of other societies outside the Nile River Valley, and the interaction between these societies and civilizations outside of Africa. In the late 7th century, North and East Africa were heavily influenced by the spread of Islam. That led to the appearance of new cultures, like the Swahili people and the Mali Empire, whose king, Musa Keita I, became one of the richest and most influential people of the early 14th century. This also led to an increase in the slave trade, which had a very bad influence on Africa’s development until the 19th century.\\n\\n Slavery \\n\\nSlavery has long been practiced in Africa, just like the rest of the world.Historical survey &gt; Slave societies , Encyclopædia BritannicaSwahili Coast , National Geographic But two new slave trades would create a much bigger and more violent version of slavery.\\n\\nBetween the 7th and 20th centuries, the Arab slave trade took 18 million slaves from Africa via trans-Saharan routes and the Indian Ocean.  Between the 15th and 20th centuries (a period of 500 years), the Atlantic slave trade took an estimated 7–12 million slaves to the Americas.Welcome to Encyclopædia Britannica's Guide to Black History , Encyclopædia Britannica While some Africans collaborated with European and Asian slave traders, many were strongly opposed to slavery and avoided, protested, or fought it violently. \\n\\nAfricans who had been captured and sent to the French colony of Saint Domingue on slave ships played an important role in ending the Atlantic slave trade. They began the Haitian Revolution, which created Haiti, the first country to permanently ban slavery. After this revolution, European empires began to reduce slave trading and abolitionism became more popular. Between 1808 and 1860, the British Navy captured approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard.Sailing against slavery. By Jo Loosemore  BBC\\n\\nthumb|left|200px|Areas of Africa under the control or influence of European nations in 1914 (at the outbreak of World War I).\\n\\n Colonialism \\nIn the late 19th century, the European powers occupied much of the continent, creating many colonial and dependent territories. They left only two fully independent states: Liberia and Ethiopia (which the Europeans called “Abyssinia\").\\n\\nEgypt and Sudan were never formally made a part of any European colonial empire. However, after the British occupation of 1882, Egypt  was effectively under British administration until 1922.\\n\\n Modern history \\nAfrican independence movements had their first success in 1951, when Libya became the first former colony to become independent.  Modern African history is full of revolutions and wars, as well as the growth of modern African economies and democratization across the continent.\\n\\nA civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire) began in 1998. Neighbouring African countries have become involved. Since the conflict began, it has killed an estimated 5.5 million people.\\n\\nPolitical associations such as the African Union offer hope for greater co-operation and peace between the continent's many countries.\\n\\n Climate \\nthumb|200px|Biomes of Africa\\nFrom north to south, Africa has most types of climate. In sequence from the north:\\n Alpine and mediterranean climate\\n Dry sandy desert\\n Fairly dry savannah (grassland)\\n Rain forest\\n More grassland\\n More deserts\\n Table Mountain\\n\\nRunning north-east to the south is the East African Great Rift Valley. This has mountains, volcanoes, deep rifts and valleys, rivers and lakes.\\n\\nIn fact, Africa has examples of most of the Earth's climate types.\\n\\n Rainfall \\nthumb|200px|The rainshadow concept, but with the wind coming from the west.\\nthumb|200px|This picture shows where vegetation is most common in February and August (before and after the summer)\\nMuch of North Africa is dry and hot: it is dominated by the Sahara Desert and does not receive much rain. In Saharan Africa, there are few rivers or other water sources. Underground water sources are very important in the desert. These often form oases. An oasis is an area of vegetation (plant life) surrounded by desert.\\n\\nIn that part of the world, the wind comes mostly from the east. That does bring rain, but the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau block the monsoon rain and prevent it from getting to North Africa. Also, the Atlas Mountains near the north coast\\nof Africa prevent rain from coming in from the north. That is another rain shadow.\\n\\nThese two rain shadows are mainly responsible for the Sahara desert.\\n\\nConditions and winds are different further south, where huge amounts of rainfall near the equator. The equator runs across the middle of Africa (see red line drawn on map). That means much of Africa is between the two tropics:\\n Tropic of Cancer\\n Tropic of Capricorn\\n\\n Plants and animals \\nthumb|200px|This oasis, in Libya, has lots of plants growing around it.\\nAfrica has a lot of wildlife.J.Hofman and S.Colbert 2009.

In particular, it is now the only continent that has many native species of large mammals. Some of them occur in very large numbers. There are antelope, buffalo, zebra, cheetah, elephant, lion, giraffe, rhinoceros, apes, hyaena, and a lot more. Over 2,000 types of fish live in African lakes and rivers.N.Myers 1997. The rich diversity of biodiversity issues. (In:Biodiversity II, ed. E.O. Wilson et al, National Academy Press.\\n\\n Politics \\nThe African Union (AU) is an international organisation. It aims to transform the African Economic Community, a federated commonwealth, into a state under established international conventions. The African Union has a parliamentary government, known as the African Union Government, consisting of legislative, judicial, and executive organs. It is led by the African Union President and Head of State, who is also the President of the Pan African Parliament. A person becomes President of the AU by being elected to the PAP and then gaining majority support in the PAP.\\n\\nExtensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of Africa, often under the oversight of the state. Most of such violations occur for political reasons, often as a side effect of civil war. Countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include Uganda, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Sudan, Zimbabwe, and Côte d'Ivoire. There are 54 UN member states in Africa.\\n\\n People \\nAfrica was the homeland for the first people.\\nPeople who come from Africa are called Africans. People in the north are called North Africans and people in the south are called South Africans. Languages in eastern Africa include Swahili, Oromo and Amharic. Languages in western Africa include Lingala, Igbo, Hausa and Fulani. The most popular language in Northern Africa is Arabic.\\nThe most populated country in Africa is Nigeria.\\n\\n Countries \\n Country Area(km²) Population Year Density(per km²) CapitalNorthern Africa2,381,74034,178,188200914Algiers (Spain)7,4922,118,5192010226Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,Santa Cruz de Tenerife (Spain)2071,50520013,575—1,001,45082,868,000201283Cairo1,759,5406,310,43420094Tripoli (Portugal)797245,0002001307Funchal (Spain)1266,41120015,534—446,55034,859,364200978Rabat1,861,48430,894,000200817Khartoum163,61010,486,339200964Tunis Western Sahara266,000405,21020092El AaiúnHorn of Africa23,000942,333201622Djibouti121,3205,647,168201647Asmara1,127,127102,403,196201675Addis Ababa637,65714,317,996201715MogadishuEast Africa27,8308,988,0912009323Gitega, Bujumbura2,170752,4382009347Moroni582,65039,002,772200966Nairobi587,04020,653,556200935Antananarivo118,48014,268,7112009120Lilongwe2,0401,284,2642009630Port Louis (France)374223,7652009490Mamoudzou801,59021,669,278200927Maputo  (France)2,512743,9812002296Saint-Denis26,33810,473,2822009398Kigali45587,4762009192Victoria619,7458,260,490200813Juba945,08744,929,002200943Dodoma236,04032,369,5582009137Kampala752,61411,862,740200916LusakaCentral Africa1,246,70012,799,293200910Luanda475,44018,879,301200940Yaoundé622,9844,511,48820097Bangui1,284,00010,329,20820098N'Djamena342,0004,012,809200912Brazzaville2,345,41069,575,000201230Kinshasa28,051633,441200923Malabo267,6671,514,99320096Libreville1,001212,6792009212São ToméSouthern Africa600,3701,990,87620093Gaborone30,3552,130,819200970Maseru825,4182,108,66520093Windhoek1,219,91251,770,560201142Bloemfontein, Cape Town, Pretoria17,3631,123,913200965Mbabane390,58011,392,629200929HarareWest Africa112,6208,791,832200978Porto-Novo274,20015,746,232200957Ouagadougou4,033429,4742009107Praia322,46020,617,068200964Abidjan, Yamoussoukro11,3001,782,8932009158Banjul239,46023,832,4952009100Accra245,85710,057,975200941Conakry36,1201,533,964200943Bissau111,3703,441,790200931Monrovia1,240,00012,666,987200910Bamako1,030,7003,129,48620093Nouakchott1,267,00015,306,252200912Niamey923,768166,629,0002012180Abuja (United Kingdom)4207,728201213Jamestown196,19013,711,597200970Dakar71,7406,440,053200990Freetown56,7856,019,8772009106Lomé Africa Total30,368,6091,001,320,281200933\\n\\n African diaspora \\n\\nCountries with significant African descendents outside Africa:\\n Haiti: 98%\\n Saint Kitts and Nevis: 96.9%\\n Anguilla: 91.4%\\n Bahamas: 86.1%\\n Barbados: 81.1%\\n Jamaica: 76.3%\\n Dominican Republic: 71.1%\\n Cayman Islands: 60.0%\\n Trinidad and Tobago: 39.5%\\n Cuba: 34.9%\\n Turks and Caicos: 34.0%\\n Belize: 29.8%\\n Venezuela: 24.0%\\n Panama: 22.0%\\n Colombia: 21.0%\\n Brazil: 13-19%\\n United States: 12.9%\\n Puerto Rico: 6.9%\\n Argentina: less than 2%\\n\\n References \\n\\n Other websites \\n\\n African &amp; Middle Eastern Reading Room from the United States Library of Congress\\n Africa South of the Sahara from Stanford University\\n The Index on Africa from The Norwegian Council for Africa\\n Aluka Digital library of scholarly resources from and about Africa\\n Africa Interactive Map from the United States Army Africa\\n\\nHistory\\n African Kingdoms\\n The Story of Africa from BBC World Service\\n Africa Policy Information Center (APIC)\\n Hungarian military forces in Africa \\n\\nNews media\\n allAfrica.com current news, events and statistics\\n Focus on Africa magazine from BBC World Service\\n\\n \\nCategory:Gondwana</td>\n",

       "      <td>Russia (, ), or the Russian Federation,\"The names Russian Federation and Russia shall be equal\".  is a country in Eastern Europe and North Asia. It has land from the Baltic Sea to the Bering Strait. It is the largest country in the world, followed by Canada, the United States, and China. Russia's population is about 146.7 million people. It is the most populous country in Europe. Moscow is its capital city. It is also the largest city in Europe. Other big cities include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod, and Kazan. Russia's official language is Russian. Russian is the most spoken language in Europe. It is also the most widely spoken Slavic language. Many regions of Russia have their own official languages alongside Russian.\\n\\nRussia has land borders with 16 countries, in both Europe and Asia. These countries are Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, China, Mongolia, and North Korea. It borders Lithuania and Poland through Kaliningrad Oblast. It also borders the unrecognised countries of South Ossetia and Abkhazia to the south. It is next to 16 seas, and 3 oceans. It is the country with the most land borders in the world. Russia is made up of 85 federal subjects. This includes Crimea and Sevastopol, which are claimed by both Russia and Ukraine. There are many different types of federal subjects. There are 46 oblasts, 22 republics, 9 krais, 4 autonomous okrugs, 3 federal cities, and 1 autonomous oblast in Russia.\\n\\nThe economy of Russia is one of the largest in the world. It ranks 11th in the world for highest nominal GDP. This is mainly because of the large amount of natural resources found in Russia. The ruble is the official currency of Russia. \\n\\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church is the largest religion in Russia. Russia has the most followers of Eastern Orthodoxy out of any other country. About 75% of Russians are followers of Eastern Orthodoxy.\\n\\nRussia is a very large and diverse country. From 1922 to 1991, it was the largest republic of the Soviet Union. The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) was based on communism. Today the government of Russia is a federal semi-presidential republic. The President is chosen by direct election. Challenging candidates do not have access to the mass media. They do have full access to social media, internet news websites, and international media. Election results match domestic, international, and exit polling. The current President of Russia is Vladimir Putin. The country has turned towards an authoritarian dictatorship under Putin's rule. The President rules the country, and the Russian Parliament plays a secondary role. Russia ranks low in measurements of human rights and freedom of the press. Corruption is also seen as a big issue.\\n\\n Etymology \\nThe name Russia comes from a Medieval Latin name for the Kievan Rus'. Rus comes from the name of the Rus' people. They were Norse merchants who settled in northern Russia. Another Medieval Latin name for Rus' was Ruthenia. The current Russian name for Russia ( / ) comes from the Byzantine Greek name for Rus' ( / ).\\n\\n History \\n\\n Prehistory \\n\\nThe first humans went to Russia in the Oldowan period of the Lower Paleolithic. Homo erectus migrated to the Taman Peninsula of Southern Russia. Flint tools have been found in Dagestan. Some of them were over 1.5 million years old. Many fossils of ancient humans were found in Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains. Russia had some of the last living Neanderthals around 45,000 years ago. They were found in Mezmaiskaya Cave in Adygea.\\n\\nthumb|300px|left|The Kurgan hypothesis.\\n\\nThe first known Homo sapiens (Ust'-Ishim man) in Russia lived around 45,000 years ago. They lived in Western Siberia. Fossils of humans from around 40,000 years ago were found at the archaeological sites of Kostyonki–Borshchyovo and Sungir. Both of these places are in European Russia. Humans got to Arctic Russia at least 40,000 years ago. Fossils and artifacts were found at Mamontovaya Kurya in the Komi Republic.\\n\\nThe Kurgan hypothesis says that the Volga-Dnieper region of southern Russia and Ukraine is the homeland of the Proto-Indo-Europeans. The Indo-Europeans moved across many parts of Eurasia and spread the Indo-European languages and Yamnaya ancestry. Artifacts from these civilizations were found in Ipatovo, Sintashta, Arkaim, and Pazyryk. The earliest known use of horses in war was found in these places as well. This region is known as the Pontic–Caspian steppe. It was named Scythia in classical antiquity.\\n\\n Antiquity \\n\\nIn the late 8th century BC, Ancient Greek traders settled Scythia. They made trading posts that turned into cities such as Tanais and Phanagoria. In the 5th century BC, the Bosporan Kingdom was created after Greek colonization of Crimea and the coast of the Sea of Azov. It became part of the Kingdom of Pontus in 107 BC until Pontus was conquered by the Roman Empire. The Bosporan Kingdom became a client state of the Roman Empire until the Bosporan Kingdom was conquered by the nomadic Huns and Pannonian Avars.Peter Turchin, Historical Dynamics: Why States Rise and Fall, Princeton University Press, 2003, pp. 185–186. . The Khazars ruled the lower Volga basin steppes until the 8th century AD.David Christian, A History of Russia, Central Asia and Mongolia, Blackwell Publishing, 1998, pp. 286–288. . They were important allies of the Eastern Roman Empire.András Róna-Tas, Hungarians and Europe in the Early Middle Ages: An Introduction to Early Hungarian History, Central European University Press, 1999, p. 257. .\\n\\n Kievan Rus' \\n\\nRussia's history began when the East Slavs settled Western Russia between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. The Varangians and their descendants made the first East Slavic state of Kievan Rus' in the 9th century. They adopted Christianity from the Byzantine Empire in 988. This form of Christianity influenced Russian culture greatly. Kievan Rus' eventually broke up and the lands were divided into many small feudal states. The most powerful successor state to Kievan Rus' was the Grand Duchy of Moscow.Mick C. (8 March 2022) How Moscow has long used the historic Kyivan Rus state to justify expansionism . The Conversation This area served as the main force in later Russian unification and the fight against the Golden Horde from Asia. Moscow slowly gained control of the regions around it and took over the cultural and political life of Kievan Rus'.\\n\\n Tsardom of Russia \\nTsardom of Russia existed from 1547 to 1721. Ivan the Terrible was the main ruler of the Tsardom of Russia. He created oprichnina and annexed many lands (Astrakhan, Siberia).\\n\\n Russian Empire \\nupright|thumbnail|Peter the Great proclaimed the Russian Empire in 1721\\nIn the 18th century, the nation had expanded through conquest, annexation and exploration. So Russian Empire, the third-largest empire in history, was formed. It stretched from the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth eastward to the Pacific Ocean and Alaska. The empire was ruled by an emperor called the Tsar.\\n\\nPeter the Great ruled Russia from 1689 until 1725. Peter moved the capital from Moscow to a new city named Saint Petersburg. He made Russian society more modern in many ways. For example, his inspectors shaved off the beards of passers. The government began building ships for the Russian navy.\\n\\nThe Russo-Japanese War started in 1904 and ended in 1905 with Japan winning the war. The Russian defeat was one of the reasons for later revolutions.\\n\\n Russian Republic \\n\\n1917 was period of revolutions in Russia. The Government was dissolved after October Revolution in 1917.  The Bolsheviks (later called \"Communists\") took over the country. They murdered the Tsar Nicholas II, as well as other people who stood against them. The Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky, created the first Marxist communist state. The Duma declared a Provisional Government. It was better known as Russian Republic.The Russian Revolution in the History Channel Encyclopedia. Vladimir Lenin was the head of government of Soviet Russia from 1917 to 1924. Russian Republic has existed from 1917 to 1918.\\n\\n USSR \\n200px|thumb|Joseph Stalin,Longest Serving Soviet Leader\\nFrom the 1924 to the 1953, Joseph Stalin ruled as the absolute dictator of Soviet Union. He destroyed anything and anyone that was against his rule. For example, he took the property of farmers and shopkeepers. Many millions of people starved and died in famines because of this.McCauley, Martin (2013). Stalin and Stalinism. Routledge. p. 43. Stalin also removed, or \"purged\", all military members who were not loyal to him.  Many people were killed or sent to prison camps, or gulags, for many years. Many prisoners died in gulags.\\n\\nSoviet Russia and Nazi Germany agreed not to attack each other in 1939. In June 1941, Germany broke the agreement and attacked in Operation Barbarossa. The attack was part of World War II. The war lasted in Europe until May 1945, and Russia lost more than 20 million people during that time. In spite of this large loss, Russia was one of the winners of the war and became a world superpower.\\n\\nIn 1961, Yuri Gagarin flew into space. He was the first man who was in space. Since this period USSR was considered to be a space power.  It was during the space race between USSR and USA.\\n\\nFrom 1922 to 1991, Russia was the largest part of the Soviet Union, or the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). People sometimes used the name \"Russia\" for the whole Soviet Union, or sometimes \"Soviet Russia\". Russia was only one of 15 Soviet Socialist Republics. The republic was in fact named the \"Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic\" (RSFSR).\\n\\nThe Soviet Union fell apart in 1991. Russia took over the place of the USSR in the United Nations (UN).\\n\\n History of present Russian Federation \\nthumb|Moscow International Business Center under construction\\nBoris Yeltsin was made the President of Russia in June 1991, in the first direct presidential election in Russian history. Wide-ranging reforms took place, for example privatization and free trade laws. Radical changes (shock therapy) were recommended by the United States and International Monetary Fund. A major economic crisis followed. There was 50% decline in GDP and industrial output between 1990 and 1995.\\n\\nThe privatization largely shifted control of enterprises from state agencies to individuals with inside connections in the government system. Many of the newly rich business people took billions in cash and assets outside of the country. The depression of state and economy led to the collapse of social services. Millions went into poverty, from 1.5% of people being in poverty in the late Soviet era to 39–49% by mid-1993. The 1990s had extreme corruption and lawlessness, and the rise of criminal gangs and violent crime.\\n\\nThe 1990s had many armed conflicts in the North Caucasus. There were both local ethnic battles and separatist Islamist insurrections. Because the Chechen separatists declared independence in the early 1990s, a Chechen War was fought between the rebel groups and the Russian military. Terrorist attacks against civilians caused hundreds of deaths. The most notable of these were the Moscow theater hostage crisis and Beslan school siege.\\n\\nRussia took responsibility for settling the USSR's external debts, even though its population made up just half of the population of the USSR at the time of its dissolution. High budget deficits caused the 1998 Russian financial crisis and resulted in more GDP decline.\\n\\nOn 31 December 1999, President Yeltsin resigned (quit being the president). The job of president was given to the recently appointed Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin. Putin then won the 2000 presidential election. Putin stopped the Chechen rebellion quickly, but violence still occurs in the Northern Caucasus at times.\\n\\nHigh oil prices and initially weak currency followed by increasing domestic demand, consumption and investments has helped the economy grow for nine straight years. This improved the standard of living and increased Russia's influence on the world stage. While many reforms made during the Putin presidency have been criticized by Western nations as un-democratic, Putin's leadership led to stability and progress. This won him widespread popularity in Russia.\\n\\nOn 2 March 2008, Dmitry Medvedev was elected President of Russia, whilst Putin became Prime Minister. Putin went back to being the president after the 2012 presidential elections, and Medvedev was made the Prime Minister.\\n\\nOn 24 February 2022, the Russian Federation attacked Ukraine, starting the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\\n\\nOn 23 June 2023, the Wagner Group, a Russian paramilitary organization, initiated a rebellion against the government of Russia. The revolt arose amidst escalating tensions between the Russian Ministry of Defense and Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of Wagner.\\n\\n Size and resources \\nAt , Russia is the largest country in the world. It covers more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area. Russia is also the world's eighth most populous nation with 140 million people as of 2022. Russia produces a lot of energy made from oil and natural gas.\\n\\nRussia extends from eastern Europe across the whole of northern Asia. Russia spans eleven time zones and has a wide range of environments and landforms. Russia has the world's largest reserves of mineral and energy resources, and is the largest producer of oil and natural gas in the world. Russia has the world's largest forest reserves,FAO. 2010. Global Forest Resources Assesment 2010. Main Report. FAO Forestry Working Paper 163, Rome, Italy   and its lakes contain about one-quarter of the world's fresh water.\\n\\n Constitution \\nRussia is a federal semi-presidential republic. It has a president and a parliament. Russia has 85 federal subjects (territorial units). All subjects of the federation shall be equal. All entities are subject to uniform federal law. Subjects of the federation have two representatives in the parliament. Subjects of the Russian Federation do not have the right to secede from it. Important issues are decided by the Federation President. Lesser powers are given to the member republics.\\n\\nAt the end of the twentieth century, Russia experienced many political changes. Some people fought to leave the federation.\\n\\nElections are held at all levels. According to Steve White, the present government made it clear that they had no plans of making a \"second edition\" of the American or British political system. Instead they wanted a system that was closer to Russia's own traditions. Richard Sakwa wrote that the Russian government is considered legitimate by the majority of the Russian people. It seeks to deliver a set of public goods without trying to fit to extra-democratic logic to achieve them. Whether the system is becoming less autocratic (dictatorial) is debatable.\\n\\n Politics \\nThere are four big political parties in Russia. United Russia (Единая Россия) is the biggest party.Reuter, Ora John (March 2010). \"The Politics of Dominant Party Formation: United Russia and Russia's Governors \". Europe-Asia Studies.

The other parties in the Duma (Russian parliament) do not criticize the government strongly, for fear of losing their places in the Duma. Many opposition parties, for the People's Freedom Party and the Other Russia, have been unable to register due to the strict rules. In the 2000s, the government led a war in Chechnya, and in the process, civil liberties and independent media were restricted. Corruption is widespread and human rights, especially in the North Caucasus, are frequently violated. In 2008, Putin's government was in a war with Georgia in a dispute over a region with many ethnic Russians.\\n\\n Geography \\nThe most western point of Russia is near Kaliningrad, formerly named Königsberg. The most eastern point of Russia is Diomid Island, 35 km from mainland Chukotka (Russia) and  from Alaska (USA). The most southern point is in Caucasus, on the border with Azerbaijan.

       "      <td>Russia (, ), or the Russian Federation,\"The names Russian Federation and Russia shall be equal\".  is a country in Eastern Europe and North Asia. It has land from the Baltic Sea to the Bering Strait. It is the largest country in the world, followed by Canada, the United States, and China. Russia's population is about 146.7 million people. It is the most populous country in Europe. Moscow is its capital city. It is also the largest city in Europe. Other big cities include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod, and Kazan. Russia's official language is Russian. Russian is the most spoken language in Europe. It is also the most widely spoken Slavic language. Many regions of Russia have their own official languages alongside Russian.\\n\\nRussia has land borders with 16 countries, in both Europe and Asia. These countries are Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, China, Mongolia, and North Korea. It borders Lithuania and Poland through Kaliningrad Oblast. It also borders the unrecognised countries of South Ossetia and Abkhazia to the south. It is next to 16 seas, and 3 oceans. It is the country with the most land borders in the world. Russia is made up of 85 federal subjects. This includes Crimea and Sevastopol, which are claimed by both Russia and Ukraine. There are many different types of federal subjects. There are 46 oblasts, 22 republics, 9 krais, 4 autonomous okrugs, 3 federal cities, and 1 autonomous oblast in Russia.\\n\\nThe economy of Russia is one of the largest in the world. It ranks 11th in the world for highest nominal GDP. This is mainly because of the large amount of natural resources found in Russia. The ruble is the official currency of Russia. \\n\\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church is the largest religion in Russia. Russia has the most followers of Eastern Orthodoxy out of any other country. About 75% of Russians are followers of Eastern Orthodoxy.\\n\\nRussia is a very large and diverse country. From 1922 to 1991, it was the largest republic of the Soviet Union. The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) was based on communism. Today the government of Russia is a federal semi-presidential republic. The President is chosen by direct election. Challenging candidates do not have access to the mass media. They do have full access to social media, internet news websites, and international media. Election results match domestic, international, and exit polling. The current President of Russia is Vladimir Putin. The country has turned towards an authoritarian dictatorship under Putin's rule. The President rules the country, and the Russian Parliament plays a secondary role. Russia ranks low in measurements of human rights and freedom of the press. Corruption is also seen as a big issue.\\n\\n Etymology \\nThe name Russia comes from a Medieval Latin name for the Kievan Rus'. Rus comes from the name of the Rus' people. They were Norse merchants who settled in northern Russia. Another Medieval Latin name for Rus' was Ruthenia. The current Russian name for Russia ( / ) comes from the Byzantine Greek name for Rus' ( / ).\\n\\n History \\n\\n Prehistory \\n\\nThe first humans went to Russia in the Oldowan period of the Lower Paleolithic. Homo erectus migrated to the Taman Peninsula of Southern Russia. Flint tools have been found in Dagestan. Some of them were over 1.5 million years old. Many fossils of ancient humans were found in Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains. Russia had some of the last living Neanderthals around 45,000 years ago. They were found in Mezmaiskaya Cave in Adygea.\\n\\nthumb|300px|left|The Kurgan hypothesis.\\n\\nThe first known Homo sapiens (Ust'-Ishim man) in Russia lived around 45,000 years ago. They lived in Western Siberia. Fossils of humans from around 40,000 years ago were found at the archaeological sites of Kostyonki–Borshchyovo and Sungir. Both of these places are in European Russia. Humans got to Arctic Russia at least 40,000 years ago. Fossils and artifacts were found at Mamontovaya Kurya in the Komi Republic.\\n\\nThe Kurgan hypothesis says that the Volga-Dnieper region of southern Russia and Ukraine is the homeland of the Proto-Indo-Europeans. The Indo-Europeans moved across many parts of Eurasia and spread the Indo-European languages and Yamnaya ancestry. Artifacts from these civilizations were found in Ipatovo, Sintashta, Arkaim, and Pazyryk. The earliest known use of horses in war was found in these places as well. This region is known as the Pontic–Caspian steppe. It was named Scythia in classical antiquity.\\n\\n Antiquity \\n\\nIn the late 8th century BC, Ancient Greek traders settled Scythia. They made trading posts that turned into cities such as Tanais and Phanagoria. In the 5th century BC, the Bosporan Kingdom was created after Greek colonization of Crimea and the coast of the Sea of Azov. It became part of the Kingdom of Pontus in 107 BC until Pontus was conquered by the Roman Empire. The Bosporan Kingdom became a client state of the Roman Empire until the Bosporan Kingdom was conquered by the nomadic Huns and Pannonian Avars.Peter Turchin, Historical Dynamics: Why States Rise and Fall, Princeton University Press, 2003, pp. 185–186. . The Khazars ruled the lower Volga basin steppes until the 8th century AD.David Christian, A History of Russia, Central Asia and Mongolia, Blackwell Publishing, 1998, pp. 286–288. . They were important allies of the Eastern Roman Empire.András Róna-Tas, Hungarians and Europe in the Early Middle Ages: An Introduction to Early Hungarian History, Central European University Press, 1999, p. 257. .\\n\\n Kievan Rus' \\n\\nRussia's history began when the East Slavs settled Western Russia between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. The Varangians and their descendants made the first East Slavic state of Kievan Rus' in the 9th century. They adopted Christianity from the Byzantine Empire in 988. This form of Christianity influenced Russian culture greatly. Kievan Rus' eventually broke up and the lands were divided into many small feudal states. The most powerful successor state to Kievan Rus' was the Grand Duchy of Moscow.Mick C. (8 March 2022) How Moscow has long used the historic Kyivan Rus state to justify expansionism . The Conversation This area served as the main force in later Russian unification and the fight against the Golden Horde from Asia. Moscow slowly gained control of the regions around it and took over the cultural and political life of Kievan Rus'.\\n\\n Tsardom of Russia \\nTsardom of Russia existed from 1547 to 1721. Ivan the Terrible was the main ruler of the Tsardom of Russia. He created oprichnina and annexed many lands (Astrakhan, Siberia).\\n\\n Russian Empire \\nupright|thumbnail|Peter the Great proclaimed the Russian Empire in 1721\\nIn the 18th century, the nation had expanded through conquest, annexation and exploration. So Russian Empire, the third-largest empire in history, was formed. It stretched from the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth eastward to the Pacific Ocean and Alaska. The empire was ruled by an emperor called the Tsar.\\n\\nPeter the Great ruled Russia from 1689 until 1725. Peter moved the capital from Moscow to a new city named Saint Petersburg. He made Russian society more modern in many ways. For example, his inspectors shaved off the beards of passers. The government began building ships for the Russian navy.\\n\\nThe Russo-Japanese War started in 1904 and ended in 1905 with Japan winning the war. The Russian defeat was one of the reasons for later revolutions.\\n\\n Russian Republic \\n\\n1917 was period of revolutions in Russia. The Government was dissolved after October Revolution in 1917.  The Bolsheviks (later called \"Communists\") took over the country. They murdered the Tsar Nicholas II, as well as other people who stood against them. The Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky, created the first Marxist communist state. The Duma declared a Provisional Government. It was better known as Russian Republic.The Russian Revolution in the History Channel Encyclopedia. Vladimir Lenin was the head of government of Soviet Russia from 1917 to 1924. Russian Republic has existed from 1917 to 1918.\\n\\n USSR \\n200px|thumb|Joseph Stalin,Longest Serving Soviet Leader\\nFrom the 1924 to the 1953, Joseph Stalin ruled as the absolute dictator of Soviet Union. He destroyed anything and anyone that was against his rule. For example, he took the property of farmers and shopkeepers. Many millions of people starved and died in famines because of this.McCauley, Martin (2013). Stalin and Stalinism. Routledge. p. 43. Stalin also removed, or \"purged\", all military members who were not loyal to him.  Many people were killed or sent to prison camps, or gulags, for many years. Many prisoners died in gulags.\\n\\nSoviet Russia and Nazi Germany agreed not to attack each other in 1939. In June 1941, Germany broke the agreement and attacked in Operation Barbarossa. The attack was part of World War II. The war lasted in Europe until May 1945, and Russia lost more than 20 million people during that time. In spite of this large loss, Russia was one of the winners of the war and became a world superpower.\\n\\nIn 1961, Yuri Gagarin flew into space. He was the first man who was in space. Since this period USSR was considered to be a space power.  It was during the space race between USSR and USA.\\n\\nFrom 1922 to 1991, Russia was the largest part of the Soviet Union, or the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). People sometimes used the name \"Russia\" for the whole Soviet Union, or sometimes \"Soviet Russia\". Russia was only one of 15 Soviet Socialist Republics. The republic was in fact named the \"Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic\" (RSFSR).\\n\\nThe Soviet Union fell apart in 1991. Russia took over the place of the USSR in the United Nations (UN).\\n\\n History of present Russian Federation \\nthumb|Moscow International Business Center under construction\\nBoris Yeltsin was made the President of Russia in June 1991, in the first direct presidential election in Russian history. Wide-ranging reforms took place, for example privatization and free trade laws. Radical changes (shock therapy) were recommended by the United States and International Monetary Fund. A major economic crisis followed. There was 50% decline in GDP and industrial output between 1990 and 1995.\\n\\nThe privatization largely shifted control of enterprises from state agencies to individuals with inside connections in the government system. Many of the newly rich business people took billions in cash and assets outside of the country. The depression of state and economy led to the collapse of social services. Millions went into poverty, from 1.5% of people being in poverty in the late Soviet era to 39–49% by mid-1993. The 1990s had extreme corruption and lawlessness, and the rise of criminal gangs and violent crime.\\n\\nThe 1990s had many armed conflicts in the North Caucasus. There were both local ethnic battles and separatist Islamist insurrections. Because the Chechen separatists declared independence in the early 1990s, a Chechen War was fought between the rebel groups and the Russian military. Terrorist attacks against civilians caused hundreds of deaths. The most notable of these were the Moscow theater hostage crisis and Beslan school siege.\\n\\nRussia took responsibility for settling the USSR's external debts, even though its population made up just half of the population of the USSR at the time of its dissolution. High budget deficits caused the 1998 Russian financial crisis and resulted in more GDP decline.\\n\\nOn 31 December 1999, President Yeltsin resigned (quit being the president). The job of president was given to the recently appointed Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin. Putin then won the 2000 presidential election. Putin stopped the Chechen rebellion quickly, but violence still occurs in the Northern Caucasus at times.\\n\\nHigh oil prices and initially weak currency followed by increasing domestic demand, consumption and investments has helped the economy grow for nine straight years. This improved the standard of living and increased Russia's influence on the world stage. While many reforms made during the Putin presidency have been criticized by Western nations as un-democratic, Putin's leadership led to stability and progress. This won him widespread popularity in Russia.\\n\\nOn 2 March 2008, Dmitry Medvedev was elected President of Russia, whilst Putin became Prime Minister. Putin went back to being the president after the 2012 presidential elections, and Medvedev was made the Prime Minister.\\n\\nOn 24 February 2022, the Russian Federation attacked Ukraine, starting the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\\n\\nOn 23 June 2023, the Wagner Group, a Russian paramilitary organization, initiated a rebellion against the government of Russia. The revolt arose amidst escalating tensions between the Russian Ministry of Defense and Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of Wagner.\\n\\n Size and resources \\nAt , Russia is the largest country in the world. It covers more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area. Russia is also the world's eighth most populous nation with 140 million people as of 2022. Russia produces a lot of energy made from oil and natural gas.\\n\\nRussia extends from eastern Europe across the whole of northern Asia. Russia spans eleven time zones and has a wide range of environments and landforms. Russia has the world's largest reserves of mineral and energy resources, and is the largest producer of oil and natural gas in the world. Russia has the world's largest forest reserves,FAO. 2010. Global Forest Resources Assesment 2010. Main Report. FAO Forestry Working Paper 163, Rome, Italy   and its lakes contain about one-quarter of the world's fresh water.\\n\\n Constitution \\nRussia is a federal semi-presidential republic. It has a president and a parliament. Russia has 85 federal subjects (territorial units). All subjects of the federation shall be equal. All entities are subject to uniform federal law. Subjects of the federation have two representatives in the parliament. Subjects of the Russian Federation do not have the right to secede from it. Important issues are decided by the Federation President. Lesser powers are given to the member republics.\\n\\nAt the end of the twentieth century, Russia experienced many political changes. Some people fought to leave the federation.\\n\\nElections are held at all levels. According to Steve White, the present government made it clear that they had no plans of making a \"second edition\" of the American or British political system. Instead they wanted a system that was closer to Russia's own traditions. Richard Sakwa wrote that the Russian government is considered legitimate by the majority of the Russian people. It seeks to deliver a set of public goods without trying to fit to extra-democratic logic to achieve them. Whether the system is becoming less autocratic (dictatorial) is debatable.\\n\\n Politics \\nThere are four big political parties in Russia. United Russia (Единая Россия) is the biggest party.Reuter, Ora John (March 2010). \"The Politics of Dominant Party Formation: United Russia and Russia's Governors \". Europe-Asia Studies.

The other parties in the Duma (Russian parliament) do not criticize the government strongly, for fear of losing their places in the Duma. Many opposition parties, for the People's Freedom Party and the Other Russia, have been unable to register due to the strict rules. In the 2000s, the government led a war in Chechnya, and in the process, civil liberties and independent media were restricted. Corruption is widespread and human rights, especially in the North Caucasus, are frequently violated. In 2008, Putin's government was in a war with Georgia in a dispute over a region with many ethnic Russians.\\n\\n Geography \\nThe most western point of Russia is near Kaliningrad, formerly named Königsberg. The most eastern point of Russia is Diomid Island, 35 km from mainland Chukotka (Russia) and  from Alaska (USA). The most southern point is in Caucasus, on the border with Azerbaijan. The most northern point is on the Franz Josef Land archipelago in Arctic Ocean,  from the North Pole.\\n\\n Cities and towns \\n\\nRussia's capital and biggest city is Moscow.

       "      <td>Belarus (officially called Republic of Belarus) is a country in Eastern Europe. About nine million people live there. Its capital is Minsk. It was part of the Soviet Union until 1991. The president of Belarus has been Alexander Lukashenko since 1994. It is bordered by Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Lithuania and Latvia. Over forty percent of its  is forested.\\n\\nThe State is a member of the UN, the CIS, Collective Security Treaty Organization, the Eurasian Economic Community, the Union State of Russia and Belarus (from 2 April 1997), as well as a member of other international organizations.\\n\\nUntil the 20th century, the lands of modern-day Belarus belonged to several countries. These included the Principality of Polotsk, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and the Russian Empire. After the Russian Revolution, Belarus became part of the Soviet Union.  It was renamed the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (BSSR). The borders of Belarus took their modern shape in 1939. Some lands occupied by Poland in 1921 were added into it after the 1939.Клоков В. Я. Великий освободительный поход Красной Армии.

In 1945 the Belorussian SSR became a founding member of the United Nations, along with the Soviet Union and the Ukrainian SSR.\\n\\nThe parliament of the republic declared the sovereignty of Belarus on  1990. During the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Belarus became independent on  1991.\\n\\nOver 70% of Belarus's population of 9.49 million live in the urban areas. More than 80% of the population are ethnic Belarusians. Most of the rest are Russians, Poles and Ukrainians. The country has two official languages: Belarusian and Russian. The main religion in the country is Russian Orthodox Christianity. The second most popular, Roman Catholicism, has a much smaller following.\\n\\nHistory\\nPrior to First World War\\nBoth Homo erectus and Neanderthal remains have been found in the region. From 5,000 to 2,000 BCE, Bandkeramik cultures lived here. Cimmerians were in the area by 1,000 BCE. By 500 BCE, Slavs moved in. The Huns and Avars came through around 400–600 CE. They were unable to move the Slavs.Historical Atlas, Ancient and Classical World, by John Haywood, 1998\\n\\nThe region that is now Belarus was first settled by Slavic tribes in the 6th century. They came into contact with the Varangians, who were bands of Scandinavian warriors and traders. They formed Kievan Rus' in 862. Polotsk and Turov become the capitals of the first principalities of today's Belarus.\\n\\nWhen Kievan Rus' ruler Yaroslav I the Wise died, the state split. Later some were added into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Lithuania made a union with Poland. The union ended in 1795. The land of Belarus went to the Russian Empire. The land stayed with Russia until going to the German Empire during World War I.\\n\\nSince initial independence\\nBelarus said they were free from Germany on  1918. They formed the Belarusian People's Republic.(Birgerson 2002:105–106) Then the Polish–Soviet War started. A part of Belarus under Soviet rule became the Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1919. Then it added to the Lithuanian–Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. The Belorussian SSR became a founding member of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1922. The western part of modern Belarus stayed part of Poland as a result of the Treaty of Riga.\\n\\nIn BSSR Byelorussian language was officially recognized together with Russian, Polish and Yiddish. A motto “Workers of all countries, unite” was written on all of this 4 languages on the republican emblem. Schools with teaching on the national languages began operating. \\n\\nIn 1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland. This was the beginning of World War II. After Polish powers left the county, the Soviet troops entered into lands with Ukrainian and Byelorussian majority, that were controlled by Poland before it. Parts of West Byelorussia were added to the Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic.  They are now West Belarus.\\n\\nNazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. BSSR was the hardest-hit Soviet republic in World War II. During that time, Germany destroyed 209 out of 290 cities in the republic, 85% of the republic's industry, and more than one million buildings. Casualties were between two and three million. The population of Belarus did not come back to its pre-war level until 1971.\\n\\nIn 1986, the Belorussian SSR had nuclear fallout from the explosion at the Chernobyl power plant in neighboring Ukrainian SSR.\\n\\nBelarus said it was free on  1990. With the support of the Communist Party, the country's name was changed to the Republic of Belarus on  1991.Country Studies Belarus – Prelude to Independence . Library of Congress. Retrieved  2007.\\n\\nGeography\\nthumb|left|280px|Strusta Lake in the Vitebsk Province\\nBelarus is landlocked and mostly flat. It has a lot of marshy land. Many streams and 11,000 lakes are found in Belarus. Three major rivers run through the country: the Neman, the Pripyat, and the Dnieper.\\n\\nThe highest point is Dzyarzhynskaya Hara at . Belarus has a hemiboreal humid continental climate (Dfb in the Koeppen climate classification).\\n\\nNatural resources include peat deposits, small amounts of oil and natural gas, granite, dolomite (limestone), marl, chalk, sand, gravel, and clay. About 70% of the radiation from neighboring Ukraine's 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster entered Belarusian territory. The farmland continues to be affected by radiation fallout.\\n\\nPolitics\\nBelarus is a presidential republic. It is governed by a president and the National Assembly.\\n\\nHuman rights\\nLukashenko has described himself as having an \"authoritarian ruling style\". Western countries have described Belarus under Lukashenko as a dictatorship. The Council of Europe has stopped Belarus from membership since 1997 for undemocratic voting.\\n\\nMilitary\\nThe Armed Forces of Belarus have three branches: the Army, the Air Force, and the Ministry of Defense joint staff. Lieutenant General Yuri Zhadobin heads the Ministry of Defense. Alexander Lukashenko (as president) is Commander-in-Chief.\\n\\nDivisions\\nBelarus is divided into six regions. They are named after the cities that are their administrative centers.\\nthumb|280px|Regions of Belarus\\nRegions (with administrative centers):\\n Brest Region (Brest)\\n Gomel Region (Gomel)\\n Grodno Region (Grodno)\\n Mogilev Region (Mogilev)\\n Minsk Region (Minsk)\\n Vitebsk Region (Vitebsk)\\n\\nSpecial administrative district:\\n Minsk City\\n\\nEconomy\\nMost of the Belarusian economy is state-controlled. It has been described as \"Soviet-style.\" The country relies on Russia for some imports, including petroleum. As of 1994, Belarus's main exports included heavy machinery (especially tractors), agricultural products, and energy products.\\n\\nDemographics\\n\\nAccording to 2019 census, the population is 9,413,446. Ethnic Belarusians are 84.9% of Belarus' total population. The next largest ethnic groups are: Russians (7.5%), Poles (3.1%), and Ukrainians (1.7%).

By the 16th century, Polotsk resident Francysk Skaryna translated the Bible into Belarusian. The modern era of Belarusian literature began in the late 19th century. One important writer was Yanka Kupala. Several poets and authors went into exile after the Nazi occupation of Belarus. They would not return until the 1960s. The last major revival of Belarusian literature was in the 1960s with novels published by Vasil Bykaŭ and Uladzimir Karatkievich.\\n\\nMusic\\nIn the 19th century, Polish composer Stanisław Moniuszko made operas and chamber music pieces while living in Minsk. At the end of the 19th century, major Belarusian cities formed their own opera and ballet companies.\\n\\nThe National Academic Theatre of Ballet, in Minsk, was awarded the Benois de la Dance Prize in 1996 as the top ballet company in the world. Rock music has become more popular in recent years, though the Belarusian government has tried to limit the amount of foreign music aired on the radio. Since 2004, Belarus has been sending artists to the Eurovision Song Contest.National State Teleradiocompany Page on the 2004 Belarusian entry to the Eurovision Song Contest. Published 2004. Retrieved 18 March 2007.\\n\\nDress\\nThe traditional Belarusian dress is from the Kievan Rus' period. Due to the cool climate, clothes were made to keep body heat and were usually made from flax or wool.\\n\\nCuisine\\nBelarusian cuisine is mainly vegetables, meat (especially pork), and breads. Foods are usually either slowly cooked or stewed. A typical Belarusian eats a light breakfast and two hearty meals, with dinner being the largest meal of the day. Wheat and rye breads are eaten in Belarus. Rye is more plentiful because conditions are too harsh for growing wheat. To show hospitality, a host will give an offering of bread and salt when greeting a guest or visitor.Canadian Citizenship and Immigration – Cultures Profile Project – Eating the Belarusian Way. Published in 1998. Retrieved 21 March 2007. Popular drinks in Belarus include Russian wheat vodka and kvass,  Kvass is a drink made from fermented malted brown bread or rye flour.

This is all happening in the context of a global famine partially triggered by the Ukraine War. Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine happen between them to be the number 1, 2, or 3 global producer of a host of industrial and agricultural inputs, as well as wheat. Losing Russia's supply of natural gas for producing nitrogen fertilizer at the same time as losing Belarus's supplies of potash and China banning exports of phosphate fertilizers (they are the world's largest producer) means the third world is going to get wiped out. Specifically, most of Russia and Ukraines agricultural export goes to the middle east, which is filled with poor countries that don't have enough arable land to feed themselves, and most of their fertilizer exports go to Africa, where poor soil means artificial fertilizer is the only thing keeping famine at bay. This is also the case in many Latin American countries. When the price of fertilizer and food goes above a certain point, third worlders will be priced out of the market. China is the world's largest food importer, being hammered by swine flu, rising prices of food and fertilizer, and its own catastrophic water management, while also suffering economic disaster and social upheaval. Iran, Iraq, Egypt, the Levant, North Africa, Pakistan, Afghanistan, these countries are going to go to war over food and water and lebensraum in the next year or so, in fact Egypt and Ethiopia already almost went to war over a Nile dam like last year. This plane is being crashed with no survivors.   \n",

The official name is People's Republic of China or PRC.\\n\\nThe last Chinese Civil War (19271949) resulted in two different political powers today:\\n\\n  The Republic of China (ROC) (since 1911), commonly known as China since 1 January, 1911 to 25 October, 1971. Now commonly known as Taiwan, has control over the islands of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu.\\n  The People's Republic of China (PRC) (since 1949), commonly known as China, has control over mainland China and the largely self-governing territories of Hong Kong (since 1997) and Macau (since 1999).\\n\\nChina is one of the world's oldest civilizations: it has the oldest continuous civilization near the Yellow River region. There is archaeological evidence over 5,000 years old. China also has one of the world's oldest writing systems (and the oldest in use today). China has been the source of many major inventions. Geographically, China’s longest river is the Yangtze River which runs through mega cities and is home to many species. It is the world’s third longest river.\\n\\n Origins \\nThe first recorded use of the word \"China\" is dated 1555.\"China\", Online Etymology Dictionary It is derived from chīnī, a Persian adjective meaning 'Chinese' which was popularized in Europe by Marco Polo.Wood, Francis, Did Marco Polo go to China (1995), p. 61.\\n\\n History \\n\\nthumb|left|The Great Wall of China\\n\\n Ancient (2100 B.C.  1500 A.D.) \\nAncient China was one of the first civilizations and was active since the 2nd millennium BC as a feudal society. Chinese civilization was also one of the few to invent writing, with the others being Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley civilization, the Maya civilization, the Minoan civilization of ancient Greece, and Ancient Egypt. It reached its golden age during the Tang Dynasty (c. A.D. 10th century). Home of Confucianism and Daoism, it had great influence on nearby countries including Japan, Korea, and Vietnam in the areas of political system, philosophy, religion, art, writing and literature. China is home to some of the oldest artwork in the world. Statues and pottery, as well as decorations made of jade, are some classic examples.\\n\\nBefore the Qin Dynasty united China, there were many small feudal states, nominally loyal to the Zhou King, that fought each other for hundreds of years in a war to control China. The majority of these states were ruled by relatives and clansmen of the Zhou royal house and carried the surname Ji (姬) and so were tied by family bonds to the Zhou king, to whom they were ritually subordinate, as members of collateral or lesser lineages. A minority of these states, such as the Qin and Chu, were ruled by non-Zhou clansmen, and were awarded their fiefs on account of some merit. Over time, these feudal states attained to power and wealth, that exceeded that of their Zhou nominal overlord, whose direct authority became confined to a very small territory near present-day Zhengzhou. These states also began to acquire some distinctive characteristics and identities of their own during the long centuries of loose control by the Zhou. Eventually, the Zhou kings were eclipsed in power by two especially problematic vassals - the Qin and Chu, and the functional independence of the Qin later led to its gradual conquest of all other vassal states and the formal supplantation of the Zhou to form a heavily centralised Empire.\\n\\nThe long decline of the Zhou, incidentally the longest ruling dynastic house of China, is known as the Warring States Period. Despite the bloodiness and strife of the period, this was the time when many great philosophies emerged - including Confucianism and Daoism as a response to disintegrating central authority of the Zhou kings and fluctuating power of the vassal states, and the general uncertainty of that era. Confucianism and Daoism have been the foundation of many social values seen in modern east Asian cultures today.\\n\\nOther notable dynasties include the Han (from which is derived the ethnonym the Han Chinese, which is synonymous with the older self-referential term - the Huaxia) as well as dynasties such as the Tang, Song, and Ming, which were characterised by periods of affluence, wealth, population growth, and the proliferation of literature.\\n\\nDuring the later years, China was often raided or invaded by northern nomadic people such as the Xiongnu, the Xianbei, the Jurchens and the Mongols (the latter led by Genghis Khan and Kublai Khan). One effect of regular nomadic invasion and the collapse of native dynasties was the massive migration of Han Chinese - especially the aristocratic elite and the literati, to sparsely populated frontier regions south of the Yangzi river such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong and Fujian. Several notable waves of Han Chinese immigration to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong and Fujian took place during the collapse of the Jin, the Tang, and the Song.\\n\\nSome nomadic groups succeeded in conquering the whole territory of China, establishing dynasties such as the Yuan (Mongol) and Qing (Manchu). Each time, they also brought new elements into Chinese culture - for instance, military uniform, the qipao and the pigtail, the latter of which was deeply resented by the Han Chinese.\\n\\n A new age \\n\\nWhile China achieved many things in the First millennium and early 2nd millennium, it became an isolationist country in the 15th century C.E. This was because Spain found enormous silver in the new continent, which was the main currency (money) in China and Europe at the time, and China did not want to be bought by the foreigners.\\n\\nBy the time of the Renaissance, European powers started to take over other countries in Asia. While China was never actually taken over, many European countries, such as Britain and France built spheres of influence in China. Since China had cut itself off from the world over the previous few centuries, by the Qing Dynasty, it had fallen behind other countries in technology, and was helpless to stop this from happening. This had become clear when it lost the Opium Wars to Britain in the 19th century.\\n\\nStill influenced by Western sources, China faced internal strife. The Taiping Rebellion or Taiping War occurred in China from 1851 through 1864. The Taiping Rebellion was led by Hong Xiuquan from Guangdong. Hong Xiuquan was influenced by Christian missionaries and declared himself the brother of Jesus. Hong made his mission to bring down the Qing Dynasty. Gaining influence on the southern Chinese population, the Taiping Rebellion attracted tens of thousands of supporters. The Taiping regime successfully created a state within the Qing Empire with the capital at Nanjing. Hong called his new state the Taiping Tianguo or \"The Heavenly State of Great Peace\". Local armies eventually suppressed the rebellion at the final battle of Nanjing.Mitter, Rana, Modern China: A Very Short Introduction p. 22.\\n\\nIn 1911, the Republic of China was founded after the Xinhai revolution led by Sun Yat-sen, but its government was very weak. Warlords controlled many areas. Chiang Kai-shek led wars against them, and he became president and dictator.\\n\\nIn 1931, Japan invaded Manchuria, a place in the northeastern part of China. On July 7, 1937, the Japanese attacked the rest of the country, starting what was called the Second Sino-Japanese War.\\n\\nOn December 13 of that same year, The Japanese Army killed an estimated (guessed) 200,000 to 300,000 Chinese civilians (people) which is called Nanjing Massacre. The war later became part of World War II. The war was fought for eight years and millions of Chinese people were killed.\\n\\nHowever, the Chinese Civil War later started between the Kuomintang (Nationalists) of the Republic of China (ROC) and the Communists of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The Communists wanted to make China like the Soviet Union, whereas the other side wanted to keep China in its current state at the time. The Communists were led by Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai and others. The Communists eventually won the war by uniting all the people from different positions. The Nationalists (led by Chiang Kai-shek) fled to the island of Taiwan and set up their new capital city in Taipei. After the Chinese Civil War, the Communist leader Mao Zedong declared a new country, the People's Republic of China (PRC), in Beijing on October 1, 1949.\\n\\nUnder Mao the country stayed poor while Taiwan became richer. His attempt at industrialization and collectivization with the Great Leap Forward led to the deaths of many people from famine. The Cultural Revolution caused great social upheaval. After 1976, China underwent market economy reforms under Deng Xiaoping, and experienced rapid economic growth, which made the former progress made by Taiwan became overshadowed. China is now one of the largest economies in the world, relying mainly on exports and manufactering.\\n\\nIn recent history, China has had problems with protests, blocking of information on the Internet, and censorship of news. 1989 was notable for the controversial Tiananmen Square protests. Since the 2008 Olympics, China has hosted many major international events, and the 2022 Winter Olympics were held in Beijing, China.\\n\\n Geography \\nthumb|Köppen-Geiger climate classification map for China\\nChina's landscape is vast and diverse. It ranges from the Gobi and Taklamakan Deserts in the north to subtropical forests in the south. The Himalaya, Karakoram, Pamir and Tian Shan mountain ranges separate China from much of South and Central Asia. The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers run from the Tibetan Plateau to the densely populated eastern coast. The Yangtze River is the third-longest river in the world while the Yellow River is the sixth-longest. China's coastline along the Pacific Ocean is 14,500 kilometers (9,000 mi) long. It is bounded by the Bohai, Yellow, East China and South China seas. China connects through the Kazakh border to the Eurasian Steppe. The Eurasian Steppe has been an artery of communication between East and West since the Neolithic through the Steppe route. The Steppe Route is the ancestor of the terrestrial Silk Road(s).\\n\\n Politics \\nthumb|The Great Hall of the People where the National People's Congress is held\\nthumb|The Zhongnanhai, a headquarter of the Chinese government and Communist Party of China\\nChina's constitution states that The People's Republic of China \"is a socialist state under the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants\". It also states the state organs \"apply the principle of democratic centralism.\" The PRC is one of the world's only socialist states openly being communist.\\n\\n Military \\nWith 2.3 million active troops, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is the largest standing military force in the world. The PLA is commanded by the Central Military Commission (CMC). China has the second-biggest military reserve force, only behind North Korea. The PLA consists of the Ground Force (PLAGF), the Navy (PLAN), the Air Force (PLAAF), and the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF). According to the Chinese government, China's military budget for 2017 was US$151,5 billion. China has the world's second-largest military budget.\\n\\n Science and technology \\nthumb|Earliest known written formula for gunpowder, from the Wujing Zongyao of 1044 CE\\nChina was once a world leader in science and technology up until the Ming dynasty. There are many Ancient Chinese discoveries and inventions. For example, papermaking, printing, the compass, and gunpowder are known as the Four Great Inventions. They became widespread across East Asia, the Middle East and later to Europe. Chinese mathematicians were the first to use negative numbers. By the 17th century, Europe and the Western world became better than China in science and technology.\\n\\n Demographics \\nThe national census of 2010 recorded the population of the People's Republic of China to be about 1,370,536,875. About 16.60% of the population were 14 years old or younger, 70.14% were between 15 and 59 years old, and 13.26% were over 60 years old. The population growth rate for 2013 is estimated to be 0.46%.\\n\\n Culture \\nChina is the origin of Eastern martial arts, called Kung Fu or its first name Wushu. China is also the home of the well-respected Spa Monastery and Wudang Mountains. Martial art started more for the purpose of survival, defense, and warfare than art. Over time some art forms have branched off, while others have retained their distinct Chinese flavor.\\n\\nChina has had renowned artists including Wong Fei Hung (Huang Fei Hung or Hwang Fei Hung) and many others. Art has also co-existed with a variety of paints including the more standard 18 colors. Legendary and controversial moves like Big Mak are also praised and talked about within the culture.\\n\\nChina has many traditional festivals, such as Spring Festival, Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-autumn Festival and so on. The most important is Chinese New Year. People in China will have holidays to celebrate these festivals.\\n\\n Festivals \\nSpring Festival is the Chinese New Year.\\n\\nDragon Boat Festival is celebrated to commemorate the death of Qu Yuan, a patriotic poet of the State of Chu during the Warring States period. He persuaded his emperor not to accept Qin's diplomats' offers several times but his emperor did not listen to him. He was very sad and ended up jumping into the river to end his life. The people loved him so much that they did not want the fish to eat his corpse. They made and threw rice dumplings into the river. They hope the fish eat these dumplings instead of the poet's corpse. They also rowed dragon boats in the river to get rid of the fish. Such practices, eating rice dumplings and holding dragon boat races, become what Chinese do in this festival nowadays.\\n\\nHeld on the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month, Mid-Autumn Festival is a festival for families. Now when the festival sets in, people would sit together to eat moon cakes, appreciate the bright full moon cakes, appreciate the bright full moon, celebrate the bumper harvest and enjoy the family love and happiness. To the Chinese people, the full moon symbolizes family reunion, as does the \"moon cakes.\" Hence the Mid-Autumn Festival is also called the Family Reunion Festival.\\n\\n Notes \\n\\n References \\n\\n Other websites \\n\\n Map of China\\n City Photo Gallery of China\\n China | Geography | People | Economy\\n China -Citizendium\\n\\nCategory:Divided regions\\n \\nCategory:Republics   \n",

It makes up about a fifth of the world's land. It is surrounded by large areas of water. There are 54 fully recognised and independent countries in Africa, and 14.7% (1.216 billion) of the world's population lives there. It is thought to be the continent where the first humans evolved.\\n\\n History \\nthumb|Civilizations before European colonization.\\nThe history of Africa begins with the first modern human beings and continues to its present difficult state as a politically developing continent.\\n\\nAfrica's ancient historic period includes the rise of Egyptian civilization.  It also includes the development of other societies outside the Nile River Valley, and the interaction between these societies and civilizations outside of Africa. In the late 7th century, North and East Africa were heavily influenced by the spread of Islam. That led to the appearance of new cultures, like the Swahili people and the Mali Empire, whose king, Musa Keita I, became one of the richest and most influential people of the early 14th century. This also led to an increase in the slave trade, which had a very bad influence on Africa’s development until the 19th century.\\n\\n Slavery \\n\\nSlavery has long been practiced in Africa, just like the rest of the world.Historical survey > Slave societies , Encyclopædia BritannicaSwahili Coast , National Geographic But two new slave trades would create a much bigger and more violent version of slavery.\\n\\nBetween the 7th and 20th centuries, the Arab slave trade took 18 million slaves from Africa via trans-Saharan routes and the Indian Ocean.  Between the 15th and 20th centuries (a period of 500 years), the Atlantic slave trade took an estimated 7–12 million slaves to the Americas.Welcome to Encyclopædia Britannica's Guide to Black History , Encyclopædia Britannica While some Africans collaborated with European and Asian slave traders, many were strongly opposed to slavery and avoided, protested, or fought it violently. \\n\\nAfricans who had been captured and sent to the French colony of Saint Domingue on slave ships played an important role in ending the Atlantic slave trade. They began the Haitian Revolution, which created Haiti, the first country to permanently ban slavery. After this revolution, European empires began to reduce slave trading and abolitionism became more popular. Between 1808 and 1860, the British Navy captured approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard.Sailing against slavery. By Jo Loosemore  BBC\\n\\nthumb|left|200px|Areas of Africa under the control or influence of European nations in 1914 (at the outbreak of World War I).\\n\\n Colonialism \\nIn the late 19th century, the European powers occupied much of the continent, creating many colonial and dependent territories. They left only two fully independent states: Liberia and Ethiopia (which the Europeans called “Abyssinia\").\\n\\nEgypt and Sudan were never formally made a part of any European colonial empire. However, after the British occupation of 1882, Egypt  was effectively under British administration until 1922.\\n\\n Modern history \\nAfrican independence movements had their first success in 1951, when Libya became the first former colony to become independent.  Modern African history is full of revolutions and wars, as well as the growth of modern African economies and democratization across the continent.\\n\\nA civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire) began in 1998. Neighbouring African countries have become involved. Since the conflict began, it has killed an estimated 5.5 million people.\\n\\nPolitical associations such as the African Union offer hope for greater co-operation and peace between the continent's many countries.\\n\\n Climate \\nthumb|200px|Biomes of Africa\\nFrom north to south, Africa has most types of climate. In sequence from the north:\\n Alpine and mediterranean climate\\n Dry sandy desert\\n Fairly dry savannah (grassland)\\n Rain forest\\n More grassland\\n More deserts\\n Table Mountain\\n\\nRunning north-east to the south is the East African Great Rift Valley. This has mountains, volcanoes, deep rifts and valleys, rivers and lakes.\\n\\nIn fact, Africa has examples of most of the Earth's climate types.\\n\\n Rainfall \\nthumb|200px|The rainshadow concept, but with the wind coming from the west.\\nthumb|200px|This picture shows where vegetation is most common in February and August (before and after the summer)\\nMuch of North Africa is dry and hot: it is dominated by the Sahara Desert and does not receive much rain. In Saharan Africa, there are few rivers or other water sources. Underground water sources are very important in the desert. These often form oases. An oasis is an area of vegetation (plant life) surrounded by desert.\\n\\nIn that part of the world, the wind comes mostly from the east. That does bring rain, but the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau block the monsoon rain and prevent it from getting to North Africa. Also, the Atlas Mountains near the north coast\\nof Africa prevent rain from coming in from the north. That is another rain shadow.\\n\\nThese two rain shadows are mainly responsible for the Sahara desert.\\n\\nConditions and winds are different further south, where huge amounts of rainfall near the equator. The equator runs across the middle of Africa (see red line drawn on map). That means much of Africa is between the two tropics:\\n Tropic of Cancer\\n Tropic of Capricorn\\n\\n Plants and animals \\nthumb|200px|This oasis, in Libya, has lots of plants growing around it.\\nAfrica has a lot of wildlife.J.Hofman and S.Colbert 2009. The ultimate guide to African mammals. Libeal House, New Jersey.J.Dorst and P.Dandelot 1983. A field guide to the larger mammals of Africa. Collins, London. There are many types of animals there. In particular, it is now the only continent that has many native species of large mammals. Some of them occur in very large numbers. There are antelope, buffalo, zebra, cheetah, elephant, lion, giraffe, rhinoceros, apes, hyaena, and a lot more. Over 2,000 types of fish live in African lakes and rivers.N.Myers 1997. The rich diversity of biodiversity issues. (In:Biodiversity II, ed. E.O. Wilson et al, National Academy Press.\\n\\n Politics \\nThe African Union (AU) is an international organisation. It aims to transform the African Economic Community, a federated commonwealth, into a state under established international conventions. The African Union has a parliamentary government, known as the African Union Government, consisting of legislative, judicial, and executive organs. It is led by the African Union President and Head of State, who is also the President of the Pan African Parliament. A person becomes President of the AU by being elected to the PAP and then gaining majority support in the PAP.\\n\\nExtensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of Africa, often under the oversight of the state. Most of such violations occur for political reasons, often as a side effect of civil war. Countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include Uganda, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Sudan, Zimbabwe, and Côte d'Ivoire. There are 54 UN member states in Africa.\\n\\n People \\nAfrica was the homeland for the first people.\\nPeople who come from Africa are called Africans. People in the north are called North Africans and people in the south are called South Africans. Languages in eastern Africa include Swahili, Oromo and Amharic. Languages in western Africa include Lingala, Igbo, Hausa and Fulani. The most popular language in Northern Africa is Arabic.\\nThe most populated country in Africa is Nigeria.\\n\\n Countries \\n Country Area(km²) Population Year Density(per km²) CapitalNorthern Africa2,381,74034,178,188200914Algiers (Spain)7,4922,118,5192010226Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,Santa Cruz de Tenerife (Spain)2071,50520013,575—1,001,45082,868,000201283Cairo1,759,5406,310,43420094Tripoli (Portugal)797245,0002001307Funchal (Spain)1266,41120015,534—446,55034,859,364200978Rabat1,861,48430,894,000200817Khartoum163,61010,486,339200964Tunis Western Sahara266,000405,21020092El AaiúnHorn of Africa23,000942,333201622Djibouti121,3205,647,168201647Asmara1,127,127102,403,196201675Addis Ababa637,65714,317,996201715MogadishuEast Africa27,8308,988,0912009323Gitega, Bujumbura2,170752,4382009347Moroni582,65039,002,772200966Nairobi587,04020,653,556200935Antananarivo118,48014,268,7112009120Lilongwe2,0401,284,2642009630Port Louis (France)374223,7652009490Mamoudzou801,59021,669,278200927Maputo  (France)2,512743,9812002296Saint-Denis26,33810,473,2822009398Kigali45587,4762009192Victoria619,7458,260,490200813Juba945,08744,929,002200943Dodoma236,04032,369,5582009137Kampala752,61411,862,740200916LusakaCentral Africa1,246,70012,799,293200910Luanda475,44018,879,301200940Yaoundé622,9844,511,48820097Bangui1,284,00010,329,20820098N'Djamena342,0004,012,809200912Brazzaville2,345,41069,575,000201230Kinshasa28,051633,441200923Malabo267,6671,514,99320096Libreville1,001212,6792009212São ToméSouthern Africa600,3701,990,87620093Gaborone30,3552,130,819200970Maseru825,4182,108,66520093Windhoek1,219,91251,770,560201142Bloemfontein, Cape Town, Pretoria17,3631,123,913200965Mbabane390,58011,392,629200929HarareWest Africa112,6208,791,832200978Porto-Novo274,20015,746,232200957Ouagadougou4,033429,4742009107Praia322,46020,617,068200964Abidjan, Yamoussoukro11,3001,782,8932009158Banjul239,46023,832,4952009100Accra245,85710,057,975200941Conakry36,1201,533,964200943Bissau111,3703,441,790200931Monrovia1,240,00012,666,987200910Bamako1,030,7003,129,48620093Nouakchott1,267,00015,306,252200912Niamey923,768166,629,0002012180Abuja (United Kingdom)4207,728201213Jamestown196,19013,711,597200970Dakar71,7406,440,053200990Freetown56,7856,019,8772009106Lomé Africa Total30,368,6091,001,320,281200933\\n\\n African diaspora \\n\\nCountries with significant African descendents outside Africa:\\n Haiti: 98%\\n Saint Kitts and Nevis: 96.9%\\n Anguilla: 91.4%\\n Bahamas: 86.1%\\n Barbados: 81.1%\\n Jamaica: 76.3%\\n Dominican Republic: 71.1%\\n Cayman Islands: 60.0%\\n Trinidad and Tobago: 39.5%\\n Cuba: 34.9%\\n Turks and Caicos: 34.0%\\n Belize: 29.8%\\n Venezuela: 24.0%\\n Panama: 22.0%\\n Colombia: 21.0%\\n Brazil: 13-19%\\n United States: 12.9%\\n Puerto Rico: 6.9%\\n Argentina: less than 2%\\n\\n References \\n\\n Other websites \\n\\n African & Middle Eastern Reading Room from the United States Library of Congress\\n Africa South of the Sahara from Stanford University\\n The Index on Africa from The Norwegian Council for Africa\\n Aluka Digital library of scholarly resources from and about Africa\\n Africa Interactive Map from the United States Army Africa\\n\\nHistory\\n African Kingdoms\\n The Story of Africa from BBC World Service\\n Africa Policy Information Center (APIC)\\n Hungarian military forces in Africa \\n\\nNews media\\n allAfrica.com current news, events and statistics\\n Focus on Africa magazine from BBC World Service\\n\\n \\nCategory:Gondwana   \n",

The President rules the country, and the Russian Parliament plays a secondary role. Russia ranks low in measurements of human rights and freedom of the press. Corruption is also seen as a big issue.\\n\\n Etymology \\nThe name Russia comes from a Medieval Latin name for the Kievan Rus'. Rus comes from the name of the Rus' people. They were Norse merchants who settled in northern Russia. Another Medieval Latin name for Rus' was Ruthenia. The current Russian name for Russia ( / ) comes from the Byzantine Greek name for Rus' ( / ).\\n\\n History \\n\\n Prehistory \\n\\nThe first humans went to Russia in the Oldowan period of the Lower Paleolithic. Homo erectus migrated to the Taman Peninsula of Southern Russia. Flint tools have been found in Dagestan. Some of them were over 1.5 million years old. Many fossils of ancient humans were found in Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains. Russia had some of the last living Neanderthals around 45,000 years ago. They were found in Mezmaiskaya Cave in Adygea.\\n\\nthumb|300px|left|The Kurgan hypothesis.\\n\\nThe first known Homo sapiens (Ust'-Ishim man) in Russia lived around 45,000 years ago. They lived in Western Siberia. Fossils of humans from around 40,000 years ago were found at the archaeological sites of Kostyonki–Borshchyovo and Sungir. Both of these places are in European Russia. Humans got to Arctic Russia at least 40,000 years ago. Fossils and artifacts were found at Mamontovaya Kurya in the Komi Republic.\\n\\nThe Kurgan hypothesis says that the Volga-Dnieper region of southern Russia and Ukraine is the homeland of the Proto-Indo-Europeans. The Indo-Europeans moved across many parts of Eurasia and spread the Indo-European languages and Yamnaya ancestry. Artifacts from these civilizations were found in Ipatovo, Sintashta, Arkaim, and Pazyryk. The earliest known use of horses in war was found in these places as well. This region is known as the Pontic–Caspian steppe. It was named Scythia in classical antiquity.\\n\\n Antiquity \\n\\nIn the late 8th century BC, Ancient Greek traders settled Scythia. They made trading posts that turned into cities such as Tanais and Phanagoria. In the 5th century BC, the Bosporan Kingdom was created after Greek colonization of Crimea and the coast of the Sea of Azov. It became part of the Kingdom of Pontus in 107 BC until Pontus was conquered by the Roman Empire. The Bosporan Kingdom became a client state of the Roman Empire until the Bosporan Kingdom was conquered by the nomadic Huns and Pannonian Avars.Peter Turchin, Historical Dynamics: Why States Rise and Fall, Princeton University Press, 2003, pp. 185–186. .

The Varangians and their descendants made the first East Slavic state of Kievan Rus' in the 9th century. They adopted Christianity from the Byzantine Empire in 988. This form of Christianity influenced Russian culture greatly. Kievan Rus' eventually broke up and the lands were divided into many small feudal states. The most powerful successor state to Kievan Rus' was the Grand Duchy of Moscow.Mick C. (8 March 2022) How Moscow has long used the historic Kyivan Rus state to justify expansionism . The Conversation This area served as the main force in later Russian unification and the fight against the Golden Horde from Asia. Moscow slowly gained control of the regions around it and took over the cultural and political life of Kievan Rus'.\\n\\n Tsardom of Russia \\nTsardom of Russia existed from 1547 to 1721. Ivan the Terrible was the main ruler of the Tsardom of Russia. He created oprichnina and annexed many lands (Astrakhan, Siberia).\\n\\n Russian Empire \\nupright|thumbnail|Peter the Great proclaimed the Russian Empire in 1721\\nIn the 18th century, the nation had expanded through conquest, annexation and exploration. So Russian Empire, the third-largest empire in history, was formed. It stretched from the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth eastward to the Pacific Ocean and Alaska. The empire was ruled by an emperor called the Tsar.\\n\\nPeter the Great ruled Russia from 1689 until 1725. Peter moved the capital from Moscow to a new city named Saint Petersburg. He made Russian society more modern in many ways. For example, his inspectors shaved off the beards of passers. The government began building ships for the Russian navy.\\n\\nThe Russo-Japanese War started in 1904 and ended in 1905 with Japan winning the war. The Russian defeat was one of the reasons for later revolutions.\\n\\n Russian Republic \\n\\n1917 was period of revolutions in Russia. The Government was dissolved after October Revolution in 1917.  The Bolsheviks (later called \"Communists\") took over the country. They murdered the Tsar Nicholas II, as well as other people who stood against them. The Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky, created the first Marxist communist state. The Duma declared a Provisional Government. It was better known as Russian Republic.The Russian Revolution in the History Channel Encyclopedia. Vladimir Lenin was the head of government of Soviet Russia from 1917 to 1924. Russian Republic has existed from 1917 to 1918.\\n\\n USSR \\n200px|thumb|Joseph Stalin,Longest Serving Soviet Leader\\nFrom the 1924 to the 1953, Joseph Stalin ruled as the absolute dictator of Soviet Union. He destroyed anything and anyone that was against his rule. For example, he took the property of farmers and shopkeepers. Many millions of people starved and died in famines because of this.McCauley, Martin (2013). Stalin and Stalinism. Routledge. p. 43. Stalin also removed, or \"purged\", all military members who were not loyal to him.  Many people were killed or sent to prison camps, or gulags, for many years. Many prisoners died in gulags.\\n\\nSoviet Russia and Nazi Germany agreed not to attack each other in 1939. In June 1941, Germany broke the agreement and attacked in Operation Barbarossa. The attack was part of World War II. The war lasted in Europe until May 1945, and Russia lost more than 20 million people during that time. In spite of this large loss, Russia was one of the winners of the war and became a world superpower.\\n\\nIn 1961, Yuri Gagarin flew into space. He was the first man who was in space. Since this period USSR was considered to be a space power.  It was during the space race between USSR and USA.\\n\\nFrom 1922 to 1991, Russia was the largest part of the Soviet Union, or the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). People sometimes used the name \"Russia\" for the whole Soviet Union, or sometimes \"Soviet Russia\". Russia was only one of 15 Soviet Socialist Republics. The republic was in fact named the \"Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic\" (RSFSR).\\n\\nThe Soviet Union fell apart in 1991. Russia took over the place of the USSR in the United Nations (UN).\\n\\n History of present Russian Federation \\nthumb|Moscow International Business Center under construction\\nBoris Yeltsin was made the President of Russia in June 1991, in the first direct presidential election in Russian history. Wide-ranging reforms took place, for example privatization and free trade laws. Radical changes (shock therapy) were recommended by the United States and International Monetary Fund. A major economic crisis followed. There was 50% decline in GDP and industrial output between 1990 and 1995.\\n\\nThe privatization largely shifted control of enterprises from state agencies to individuals with inside connections in the government system. Many of the newly rich business people took billions in cash and assets outside of the country. The depression of state and economy led to the collapse of social services. Millions went into poverty, from 1.5% of people being in poverty in the late Soviet era to 39–49% by mid-1993. The 1990s had extreme corruption and lawlessness, and the rise of criminal gangs and violent crime.\\n\\nThe 1990s had many armed conflicts in the North Caucasus. There were both local ethnic battles and separatist Islamist insurrections. Because the Chechen separatists declared independence in the early 1990s, a Chechen War was fought between the rebel groups and the Russian military. Terrorist attacks against civilians caused hundreds of deaths. The most notable of these were the Moscow theater hostage crisis and Beslan school siege.\\n\\nRussia took responsibility for settling the USSR's external debts, even though its population made up just half of the population of the USSR at the time of its dissolution. High budget deficits caused the 1998 Russian financial crisis and resulted in more GDP decline.\\n\\nOn 31 December 1999, President Yeltsin resigned (quit being the president). The job of president was given to the recently appointed Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin. Putin then won the 2000 presidential election. Putin stopped the Chechen rebellion quickly, but violence still occurs in the Northern Caucasus at times.\\n\\nHigh oil prices and initially weak currency followed by increasing domestic demand, consumption and investments has helped the economy grow for nine straight years. This improved the standard of living and increased Russia's influence on the world stage. While many reforms made during the Putin presidency have been criticized by Western nations as un-democratic, Putin's leadership led to stability and progress. This won him widespread popularity in Russia.\\n\\nOn 2 March 2008, Dmitry Medvedev was elected President of Russia, whilst Putin became Prime Minister. Putin went back to being the president after the 2012 presidential elections, and Medvedev was made the Prime Minister.\\n\\nOn 24 February 2022, the Russian Federation attacked Ukraine, starting the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\\n\\nOn 23 June 2023, the Wagner Group, a Russian paramilitary organization, initiated a rebellion against the government of Russia. The revolt arose amidst escalating tensions between the Russian Ministry of Defense and Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of Wagner.\\n\\n Size and resources \\nAt , Russia is the largest country in the world. It covers more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area. Russia is also the world's eighth most populous nation with 140 million people as of 2022. Russia produces a lot of energy made from oil and natural gas.\\n\\nRussia extends from eastern Europe across the whole of northern Asia. Russia spans eleven time zones and has a wide range of environments and landforms. Russia has the world's largest reserves of mineral and energy resources, and is the largest producer of oil and natural gas in the world. Russia has the world's largest forest reserves,FAO. 2010. Global Forest Resources Assesment 2010. Main Report. FAO Forestry Working Paper 163, Rome, Italy   and its lakes contain about one-quarter of the world's fresh water.\\n\\n Constitution \\nRussia is a federal semi-presidential republic. It has a president and a parliament. Russia has 85 federal subjects (territorial units). All subjects of the federation shall be equal. All entities are subject to uniform federal law. Subjects of the federation have two representatives in the parliament. Subjects of the Russian Federation do not have the right to secede from it. Important issues are decided by the Federation President. Lesser powers are given to the member republics.\\n\\nAt the end of the twentieth century, Russia experienced many political changes. Some people fought to leave the federation.\\n\\nElections are held at all levels. According to Steve White, the present government made it clear that they had no plans of making a \"second edition\" of the American or British political system. Instead they wanted a system that was closer to Russia's own traditions. Richard Sakwa wrote that the Russian government is considered legitimate by the majority of the Russian people. It seeks to deliver a set of public goods without trying to fit to extra-democratic logic to achieve them. Whether the system is becoming less autocratic (dictatorial) is debatable.\\n\\n Politics \\nThere are four big political parties in Russia. United Russia (Единая Россия) is the biggest party.Reuter, Ora John (March 2010). \"The Politics of Dominant Party Formation: United Russia and Russia's Governors \". Europe-Asia Studies.

The other parties in the Duma (Russian parliament) do not criticize the government strongly, for fear of losing their places in the Duma. Many opposition parties, for the People's Freedom Party and the Other Russia, have been unable to register due to the strict rules. In the 2000s, the government led a war in Chechnya, and in the process, civil liberties and independent media were restricted. Corruption is widespread and human rights, especially in the North Caucasus, are frequently violated. In 2008, Putin's government was in a war with Georgia in a dispute over a region with many ethnic Russians.\\n\\n Geography \\nThe most western point of Russia is near Kaliningrad, formerly named Königsberg. The most eastern point of Russia is Diomid Island, 35 km from mainland Chukotka (Russia) and  from Alaska (USA). The most southern point is in Caucasus, on the border with Azerbaijan. The most northern point is on the Franz Josef Land archipelago in Arctic Ocean,  from the North Pole.\\n\\n Cities and towns \\n\\nRussia's capital and biggest city is Moscow. The second biggest city is Saint Petersburg, which was the capital of Russia in the 18th and 19th centuries.\\n\\n Administrative divisions \\n\\nRussia is divided into many different types of administrative divisions.

Many people think Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky are two of the greatest novelists ever. Three Russians won the Nobel Prize for Literature in the 20th century: Boris Pasternak (1958), Mikhail Sholokhov (1965) and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn (1980).  Mikhail Bulgakov was one of the most popular writers of the 20th century.Lovell, Stephen (1998). \"Bulgakov as Soviet Culture\". The Slavonic and East European Review.

The republic was in fact named the \"Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic\" (RSFSR).\\n\\nThe Soviet Union fell apart in 1991. Russia took over the place of the USSR in the United Nations (UN).\\n\\n History of present Russian Federation \\nthumb|Moscow International Business Center under construction\\nBoris Yeltsin was made the President of Russia in June 1991, in the first direct presidential election in Russian history. Wide-ranging reforms took place, for example privatization and free trade laws. Radical changes (shock therapy) were recommended by the United States and International Monetary Fund. A major economic crisis followed. There was 50% decline in GDP and industrial output between 1990 and 1995.\\n\\nThe privatization largely shifted control of enterprises from state agencies to individuals with inside connections in the government system. Many of the newly rich business people took billions in cash and assets outside of the country. The depression of state and economy led to the collapse of social services. Millions went into poverty, from 1.5% of people being in poverty in the late Soviet era to 39–49% by mid-1993. The 1990s had extreme corruption and lawlessness, and the rise of criminal gangs and violent crime.\\n\\nThe 1990s had many armed conflicts in the North Caucasus. There were both local ethnic battles and separatist Islamist insurrections. Because the Chechen separatists declared independence in the early 1990s, a Chechen War was fought between the rebel groups and the Russian military. Terrorist attacks against civilians caused hundreds of deaths. The most notable of these were the Moscow theater hostage crisis and Beslan school siege.\\n\\nRussia took responsibility for settling the USSR's external debts, even though its population made up just half of the population of the USSR at the time of its dissolution. High budget deficits caused the 1998 Russian financial crisis and resulted in more GDP decline.\\n\\nOn 31 December 1999, President Yeltsin resigned (quit being the president). The job of president was given to the recently appointed Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin. Putin then won the 2000 presidential election. Putin stopped the Chechen rebellion quickly, but violence still occurs in the Northern Caucasus at times.\\n\\nHigh oil prices and initially weak currency followed by increasing domestic demand, consumption and investments has helped the economy grow for nine straight years. This improved the standard of living and increased Russia's influence on the world stage. While many reforms made during the Putin presidency have been criticized by Western nations as un-democratic, Putin's leadership led to stability and progress. This won him widespread popularity in Russia.\\n\\nOn 2 March 2008, Dmitry Medvedev was elected President of Russia, whilst Putin became Prime Minister. Putin went back to being the president after the 2012 presidential elections, and Medvedev was made the Prime Minister.\\n\\nOn 24 February 2022, the Russian Federation attacked Ukraine, starting the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\\n\\nOn 23 June 2023, the Wagner Group, a Russian paramilitary organization, initiated a rebellion against the government of Russia. The revolt arose amidst escalating tensions between the Russian Ministry of Defense and Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of Wagner.\\n\\n Size and resources \\nAt , Russia is the largest country in the world. It covers more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area. Russia is also the world's eighth most populous nation with 140 million people as of 2022. Russia produces a lot of energy made from oil and natural gas.\\n\\nRussia extends from eastern Europe across the whole of northern Asia. Russia spans eleven time zones and has a wide range of environments and landforms. Russia has the world's largest reserves of mineral and energy resources, and is the largest producer of oil and natural gas in the world. Russia has the world's largest forest reserves,FAO. 2010. Global Forest Resources Assesment 2010. Main Report. FAO Forestry Working Paper 163, Rome, Italy   and its lakes contain about one-quarter of the world's fresh water.\\n\\n Constitution \\nRussia is a federal semi-presidential republic. It has a president and a parliament. Russia has 85 federal subjects (territorial units). All subjects of the federation shall be equal. All entities are subject to uniform federal law. Subjects of the federation have two representatives in the parliament. Subjects of the Russian Federation do not have the right to secede from it. Important issues are decided by the Federation President. Lesser powers are given to the member republics.\\n\\nAt the end of the twentieth century, Russia experienced many political changes. Some people fought to leave the federation.\\n\\nElections are held at all levels. According to Steve White, the present government made it clear that they had no plans of making a \"second edition\" of the American or British political system. Instead they wanted a system that was closer to Russia's own traditions. Richard Sakwa wrote that the Russian government is considered legitimate by the majority of the Russian people. It seeks to deliver a set of public goods without trying to fit to extra-democratic logic to achieve them. Whether the system is becoming less autocratic (dictatorial) is debatable.\\n\\n Politics \\nThere are four big political parties in Russia. United Russia (Единая Россия) is the biggest party.Reuter, Ora John (March 2010). \"The Politics of Dominant Party Formation: United Russia and Russia's Governors \". Europe-Asia Studies.

The other parties in the Duma (Russian parliament) do not criticize the government strongly, for fear of losing their places in the Duma. Many opposition parties, for the People's Freedom Party and the Other Russia, have been unable to register due to the strict rules. In the 2000s, the government led a war in Chechnya, and in the process, civil liberties and independent media were restricted. Corruption is widespread and human rights, especially in the North Caucasus, are frequently violated. In 2008, Putin's government was in a war with Georgia in a dispute over a region with many ethnic Russians.\\n\\n Geography \\nThe most western point of Russia is near Kaliningrad, formerly named Königsberg. The most eastern point of Russia is Diomid Island, 35 km from mainland Chukotka (Russia) and  from Alaska (USA). The most southern point is in Caucasus, on the border with Azerbaijan. The most northern point is on the Franz Josef Land archipelago in Arctic Ocean,  from the North Pole.\\n\\n Cities and towns \\n\\nRussia's capital and biggest city is Moscow. The second biggest city is Saint Petersburg, which was the capital of Russia in the 18th and 19th centuries.\\n\\n Administrative divisions \\n\\nRussia is divided into many different types of administrative divisions. Some of these are called federal subjects. They are the top-level subdivision of Russia. Other types of Russian subdivisions include federal districts and economic regions.thumb|center|500px|Federal subjects of the Russian Federation\\n\\n Demographics \\nEthnic composition (2010)Russians80.90%Tatars3.87%Ukrainians1.40%Bashkirs1.15%Chuvash1.05%Chechen1.04%Armenians0.86%Other/unspecified9.73%\\nthumbnail|right|Population (in millions) 1950–January 2009.\\n\\nRussia has a population of 142 million people.

Alexander Pushkin is considered a founder of modern Russian literature. He was a poet from the 19th century.\\n\\nOther famous poets and writers of the 19th century were Anton Chekhov, Mikhail Lermontov, Leo Tolstoy, Nikolai Gogol (he was born in what is now Ukraine, but during his lifetime Ukraine was a part of Russia), Ivan Turgenev and Fyodor Dostoyevsky. Many people think Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky are two of the greatest novelists ever. Three Russians won the Nobel Prize for Literature in the 20th century: Boris Pasternak (1958), Mikhail Sholokhov (1965) and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn (1980).  Mikhail Bulgakov was one of the most popular writers of the 20th century.Lovell, Stephen (1998). \"Bulgakov as Soviet Culture\". The Slavonic and East European Review.

Those who were not caught doping were able to play in the 2018 Olympics as \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\". They won two gold medals, and one in ice hockey.\\n\\nIn 6 appearances, Russian athletes have won a total of 425 medals at the summer Olympics and 121 at the winter Olympics. However, more than 30% of these medals were taken from Russia and its teams.\\n\\n Chess \\nChess is the main intellectual sport in Russia.

country in Eastern Europe. About nine million people live there. Its capital is Minsk. It was part of the Soviet Union until 1991. The president of Belarus has been Alexander Lukashenko since 1994. It is bordered by Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Lithuania and Latvia. Over forty percent of its  is forested.\\n\\nThe State is a member of the UN, the CIS, Collective Security Treaty Organization, the Eurasian Economic Community, the Union State of Russia and Belarus (from 2 April 1997), as well as a member of other international organizations.\\n\\nUntil the 20th century, the lands of modern-day Belarus belonged to several countries. These included the Principality of Polotsk, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and the Russian Empire. After the Russian Revolution, Belarus became part of the Soviet Union.  It was renamed the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (BSSR). The borders of Belarus took their modern shape in 1939. Some lands occupied by Poland in 1921 were added into it after the 1939.Клоков В. Я. Великий освободительный поход Красной Армии.

In 1945 the Belorussian SSR became a founding member of the United Nations, along with the Soviet Union and the Ukrainian SSR.\\n\\nThe parliament of the republic declared the sovereignty of Belarus on  1990. During the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Belarus became independent on  1991.\\n\\nOver 70% of Belarus's population of 9.49 million live in the urban areas. More than 80% of the population are ethnic Belarusians. Most of the rest are Russians, Poles and Ukrainians. The country has two official languages: Belarusian and Russian. The main religion in the country is Russian Orthodox Christianity. The second most popular, Roman Catholicism, has a much smaller following.\\n\\nHistory\\nPrior to First World War\\nBoth Homo erectus and Neanderthal remains have been found in the region. From 5,000 to 2,000 BCE, Bandkeramik cultures lived here. Cimmerians were in the area by 1,000 BCE. By 500 BCE, Slavs moved in. The Huns and Avars came through around 400–600 CE. They were unable to move the Slavs.Historical Atlas, Ancient and Classical World, by John Haywood, 1998\\n\\nThe region that is now Belarus was first settled by Slavic tribes in the 6th century. They came into contact with the Varangians, who were bands of Scandinavian warriors and traders. They formed Kievan Rus' in 862. Polotsk and Turov become the capitals of the first principalities of today's Belarus.\\n\\nWhen Kievan Rus' ruler Yaroslav I the Wise died, the state split. Later some were added into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Lithuania made a union with Poland. The union ended in 1795. The land of Belarus went to the Russian Empire. The land stayed with Russia until going to the German Empire during World War I.\\n\\nSince initial independence\\nBelarus said they were free from Germany on  1918. They formed the Belarusian People's Republic.(Birgerson 2002:105–106) Then the Polish–Soviet War started. A part of Belarus under Soviet rule became the Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1919. Then it added to the Lithuanian–Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. The Belorussian SSR became a founding member of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1922. The western part of modern Belarus stayed part of Poland as a result of the Treaty of Riga.\\n\\nIn BSSR Byelorussian language was officially recognized together with Russian, Polish and Yiddish. A motto “Workers of all countries, unite” was written on all of this 4 languages on the republican emblem. Schools with teaching on the national languages began operating. \\n\\nIn 1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland. This was the beginning of World War II. After Polish powers left the county, the Soviet troops entered into lands with Ukrainian and Byelorussian majority, that were controlled by Poland before it. Parts of West Byelorussia were added to the Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic.  They are now West Belarus.\\n\\nNazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. BSSR was the hardest-hit Soviet republic in World War II. During that time, Germany destroyed 209 out of 290 cities in the republic, 85% of the republic's industry, and more than one million buildings. Casualties were between two and three million. The population of Belarus did not come back to its pre-war level until 1971.\\n\\nIn 1986, the Belorussian SSR had nuclear fallout from the explosion at the Chernobyl power plant in neighboring Ukrainian SSR.\\n\\nBelarus said it was free on  1990. With the support of the Communist Party, the country's name was changed to the Republic of Belarus on  1991.Country Studies Belarus – Prelude to Independence . Library of Congress. Retrieved  2007.\\n\\nGeography\\nthumb|left|280px|Strusta Lake in the Vitebsk Province\\nBelarus is landlocked and mostly flat. It has a lot of marshy land. Many streams and 11,000 lakes are found in Belarus. Three major rivers run through the country: the Neman, the Pripyat, and the Dnieper.\\n\\nThe highest point is Dzyarzhynskaya Hara at . Belarus has a hemiboreal humid continental climate (Dfb in the Koeppen climate classification).\\n\\nNatural resources include peat deposits, small amounts of oil and natural gas, granite, dolomite (limestone), marl, chalk, sand, gravel, and clay. About 70% of the radiation from neighboring Ukraine's 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster entered Belarusian territory. The farmland continues to be affected by radiation fallout.\\n\\nPolitics\\nBelarus is a presidential republic. It is governed by a president and the National Assembly.\\n\\nHuman rights\\nLukashenko has described himself as having an \"authoritarian ruling style\". Western countries have described Belarus under Lukashenko as a dictatorship. The Council of Europe has stopped Belarus from membership since 1997 for undemocratic voting.\\n\\nMilitary\\nThe Armed Forces of Belarus have three branches: the Army, the Air Force, and the Ministry of Defense joint staff. Lieutenant General Yuri Zhadobin heads the Ministry of Defense. Alexander Lukashenko (as president) is Commander-in-Chief.\\n\\nDivisions\\nBelarus is divided into six regions. They are named after the cities that are their administrative centers.\\nthumb|280px|Regions of Belarus\\nRegions (with administrative centers):\\n Brest Region (Brest)\\n Gomel Region (Gomel)\\n Grodno Region (Grodno)\\n Mogilev Region (Mogilev)\\n Minsk Region (Minsk)\\n Vitebsk Region (Vitebsk)\\n\\nSpecial administrative district:\\n Minsk City\\n\\nEconomy\\nMost of the Belarusian economy is state-controlled. It has been described as \"Soviet-style.\" The country relies on Russia for some imports, including petroleum. As of 1994, Belarus's main exports included heavy machinery (especially tractors), agricultural products, and energy products.\\n\\nDemographics\\n\\nAccording to 2019 census, the population is 9,413,446. Ethnic Belarusians are 84.9% of Belarus' total population. The next largest ethnic groups are: Russians (7.5%), Poles (3.1%), and Ukrainians (1.7%). Minsk, the nation's capital and largest city, is home to 2,018,281 residents as of 2019. Gomel, with 481,000 people, is the second-largest city and is the capital of the Homiel Voblast. Other large cities are Mogilev (365,100), Vitebsk (342,400), Hrodna (314,800) and Brest (298,300).World Gazette Largest Cities of Belarus (2007). Published in 2007. Retrieved 19 March 2007.

By the 16th century, Polotsk resident Francysk Skaryna translated the Bible into Belarusian. The modern era of Belarusian literature began in the late 19th century. One important writer was Yanka Kupala. Several poets and authors went into exile after the Nazi occupation of Belarus. They would not return until the 1960s. The last major revival of Belarusian literature was in the 1960s with novels published by Vasil Bykaŭ and Uladzimir Karatkievich.\\n\\nMusic\\nIn the 19th century, Polish composer Stanisław Moniuszko made operas and chamber music pieces while living in Minsk. At the end of the 19th century, major Belarusian cities formed their own opera and ballet companies.\\n\\nThe National Academic Theatre of Ballet, in Minsk, was awarded the Benois de la Dance Prize in 1996 as the top ballet company in the world. Rock music has become more popular in recent years, though the Belarusian government has tried to limit the amount of foreign music aired on the radio. Since 2004, Belarus has been sending artists to the Eurovision Song Contest.National State Teleradiocompany Page on the 2004 Belarusian entry to the Eurovision Song Contest. Published 2004. Retrieved 18 March 2007.\\n\\nDress\\nThe traditional Belarusian dress is from the Kievan Rus' period. Due to the cool climate, clothes were made to keep body heat and were usually made from flax or wool.\\n\\nCuisine\\nBelarusian cuisine is mainly vegetables, meat (especially pork), and breads. Foods are usually either slowly cooked or stewed. A typical Belarusian eats a light breakfast and two hearty meals, with dinner being the largest meal of the day. Wheat and rye breads are eaten in Belarus. Rye is more plentiful because conditions are too harsh for growing wheat. To show hospitality, a host will give an offering of bread and salt when greeting a guest or visitor.Canadian Citizenship and Immigration – Cultures Profile Project – Eating the Belarusian Way. Published in 1998. Retrieved 21 March 2007. Popular drinks in Belarus include Russian wheat vodka and kvass,  Kvass is a drink made from fermented malted brown bread or rye flour. Kvass may also be added with sliced vegetables to create a cold soup called okroshka.University of Nebraska-Lincoln – Institute of Agriculture and National Resources.
